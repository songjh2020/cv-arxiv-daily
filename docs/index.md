In real-world scenarios, obtaining accurate poses is challenging, leading to noisy pose estimates and geometric misalignments. To address this, we introduce SHARE, a pose-free, feed-forward Gaussian splatting framework that overcomes these ambiguities by joint shape and camera rays estimation. Instead of relying on explicit 3D transformations, SHARE builds a pose-aware canonical volume representation that seamlessly integrates multi-view information, reducing misalignment caused by inaccurate pose estimates. Additionally, anchor-aligned Gaussian prediction enhances scene reconstruction by refining local geometry around coarse anchors, allowing for more precise Gaussian placement. Extensive experiments on diverse real-world datasets show that our method achieves robust performance in pose-free generalizable Gaussian splatting.</p></details>|[2505.22978](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22978)|null|
|**2025-05-28**|**TwinTrack: Bridging Vision and Contact Physics for Real-Time Tracking of Unknown Dynamic Objects**|<details><summary>Show Abstract</summary><p>Real-time tracking of previously unseen, highly dynamic objects in contact-rich environments -- such as during dexterous in-hand manipulation -- remains a significant challenge. Purely vision-based tracking often suffers from heavy occlusions due to the frequent contact interactions and motion blur caused by abrupt motion during contact impacts. We propose TwinTrack, a physics-aware visual tracking framework that enables robust and real-time 6-DoF pose tracking of unknown dynamic objects in a contact-rich scene by leveraging the contact physics of the observed scene. At the core of TwinTrack is an integration of Real2Sim and Sim2Real. In Real2Sim, we combine the complementary strengths of vision and contact physics to estimate object's collision geometry and physical properties: object's geometry is first reconstructed from vision, then updated along with other physical parameters from contact dynamics for physical accuracy. In Sim2Real, robust pose estimation of the object is achieved by adaptive fusion between visual tracking and prediction of the learned contact physics. TwinTrack is built on a GPU-accelerated, deeply customized physics engine to ensure real-time performance. We evaluate our method on two contact-rich scenarios: object falling with rich contact impacts against the environment, and contact-rich in-hand manipulation. Experimental results demonstrate that, compared to baseline methods, TwinTrack achieves significantly more robust, accurate, and real-time 6-DoF tracking in these challenging scenarios, with tracking speed exceeding 20 Hz.

|**2025-05-28**|**4DTAM: Non-Rigid Tracking and Mapping via Dynamic Surface Gaussians**|<details><summary>Show Abstract</summary><p>We propose the first 4D tracking and mapping method that jointly performs camera localization and non-rigid surface reconstruction via differentiable rendering. Our approach captures 4D scenes from an online stream of color images with depth measurements or predictions by jointly optimizing scene geometry, appearance, dynamics, and camera ego-motion. Although natural environments exhibit complex non-rigid motions, 4D-SLAM remains relatively underexplored due to its inherent challenges; even with 2.5D signals, the problem is ill-posed because of the high dimensionality of the optimization space. To overcome these challenges, we first introduce a SLAM method based on Gaussian surface primitives that leverages depth signals more effectively than 3D Gaussians, thereby achieving accurate surface reconstruction. To further model non-rigid deformations, we employ a warp-field represented by a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) and introduce a novel camera pose estimation technique along with surface regularization terms that facilitate spatio-temporal reconstruction. In addition to these algorithmic challenges, a significant hurdle in 4D SLAM research is the lack of reliable ground truth and evaluation protocols, primarily due to the difficulty of 4D capture using commodity sensors. To address this, we present a novel open synthetic dataset of everyday objects with diverse motions, leveraging large-scale object models and animation modeling. In summary, we open up the modern 4D-SLAM research by introducing a novel method and evaluation protocols grounded in modern vision and rendering techniques.</p></details>|[2505.22859](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22859)|null|
|**2025-05-28**|**MultiFormer: A Multi-Person Pose Estimation System Based on CSI and Attention Mechanism**|<details><summary>Show Abstract</summary><p>Human pose estimation based on Channel State Information (CSI) has emerged as a promising approach for non-intrusive and precise human activity monitoring, yet faces challenges including accurate multi-person pose recognition and effective CSI feature learning. This paper presents MultiFormer, a wireless sensing system that accurately estimates human pose through CSI. The proposed system adopts a Transformer based time-frequency dual-token feature extractor with multi-head self-attention. This feature extractor is able to model inter-subcarrier correlations and temporal dependencies of the CSI. The extracted CSI features and the pose probability heatmaps are then fused by Multi-Stage Feature Fusion Network (MSFN) to enforce the anatomical constraints. Extensive experiments conducted on on the public MM-Fi dataset and our self-collected dataset show that the MultiFormer achieves higher accuracy over state-of-the-art approaches, especially for high-mobility keypoints (wrists, elbows) that are particularly difficult for previous methods to accurately estimate.</p></details>|[2505.22555](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22555)|null|
|**2025-05-28**|**Event-based Egocentric Human Pose Estimation in Dynamic Environment**|<details><summary>Show Abstract</summary><p>Estimating human pose using a front-facing egocentric camera is essential for applications such as sports motion analysis, VR/AR, and AI for wearable devices. However, many existing methods rely on RGB cameras and do not account for low-light environments or motion blur. Event-based cameras have the potential to address these challenges. In this work, we introduce a novel task of human pose estimation using a front-facing event-based camera mounted on the head and propose D-EventEgo, the first framework for this task. The proposed method first estimates the head poses, and then these are used as conditions to generate body poses. However, when estimating head poses, the presence of dynamic objects mixed with background events may reduce head pose estimation accuracy. Therefore, we introduce the Motion Segmentation Module to remove dynamic objects and extract background information. Extensive experiments on our synthetic event-based dataset derived from EgoBody, demonstrate that our approach outperforms our baseline in four out of five evaluation metrics in dynamic environments.</p></details>|[2505.22007](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22007)|null|
|**2025-05-27**|**Spectral Compression Transformer with Line Pose Graph for Monocular 3D Human Pose Estimation**|<details><summary>Show Abstract</summary><p>Transformer-based 3D human pose estimation methods suffer from high computational costs due to the quadratic complexity of self-attention with respect to sequence length. Additionally, pose sequences often contain significant redundancy between frames. However, recent methods typically fail to improve model capacity while effectively eliminating sequence redundancy. In this work, we introduce the Spectral Compression Transformer (SCT) to reduce sequence length and accelerate computation. The SCT encoder treats hidden features between blocks as Temporal Feature Signals (TFS) and applies the Discrete Cosine Transform, a Fourier transform-based technique, to determine the spectral components to be retained. By filtering out certain high-frequency noise components, SCT compresses the sequence length and reduces redundancy. To further enrich the input sequence with prior structural information, we propose the Line Pose Graph (LPG) based on line graph theory. The LPG generates skeletal position information that complements the input 2D joint positions, thereby improving the model's performance. Finally, we design a dual-stream network architecture to effectively model spatial joint relationships and the compressed motion trajectory within the pose sequence. Extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets (i.e., Human3.6M and MPI-INF-3DHP) demonstrate that our model achieves state-of-the-art performance with improved computational efficiency. For example, on the Human3.6M dataset, our method achieves an MPJPE of 37.7mm while maintaining a low computational cost. Furthermore, we perform ablation studies on each module to assess its effectiveness. The code and models will be released.</p></details>|[2505.21309](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21309)|null|
|**2025-05-29**|**ReassembleNet: Learnable Keypoints and Diffusion for 2D Fresco Reconstruction**|<details><summary>Show Abstract</summary><p>The task of reassembly is a significant challenge across multiple domains, including archaeology, genomics, and molecular docking, requiring the precise placement and orientation of elements to reconstruct an original structure. In this work, we address key limitations in state-of-the-art Deep Learning methods for reassembly, namely i) scalability; ii) multimodality; and iii) real-world applicability: beyond square or simple geometric shapes, realistic and complex erosion, or other real-world problems. We propose ReassembleNet, a method that reduces complexity by representing each input piece as a set of contour keypoints and learning to select the most informative ones by Graph Neural Networks pooling inspired techniques. ReassembleNet effectively lowers computational complexity while enabling the integration of features from multiple modalities, including both geometric and texture data. Further enhanced through pretraining on a semi-synthetic dataset. We then apply diffusion-based pose estimation to recover the original structure. We improve on prior methods by 55% and 86% for RMSE Rotation and Translation, respectively.</p></details>|[2505.21117](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21117)|null|
|**2025-05-27**|**HS-SLAM: A Fast and Hybrid Strategy-Based SLAM Approach for Low-Speed Autonomous Driving**|<details><summary>Show Abstract</summary><p>Visual-inertial simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) is a key module of robotics and low-speed autonomous vehicles, which is usually limited by the high computation burden for practical applications. To this end, an innovative strategy-based hybrid framework HS-SLAM is proposed to integrate the advantages of direct and feature-based methods for fast computation without decreasing the performance. It first estimates the relative positions of consecutive frames using IMU pose estimation within the tracking thread. Then, it refines these estimates through a multi-layer direct method, which progressively corrects the relative pose from coarse to fine, ultimately achieving accurate corner-based feature matching. This approach serves as an alternative to the conventional constant-velocity tracking model. By selectively bypassing descriptor extraction for non-critical frames, HS-SLAM significantly improves the tracking speed. Experimental evaluations on the EuRoC MAV dataset demonstrate that HS-SLAM achieves higher localization accuracies than ORB-SLAM3 while improving the average tracking efficiency by 15%.</p></details>|[2505.20906](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20906)|null|
|**2025-05-27**|**Mamba-Driven Topology Fusion for Monocular 3-D Human Pose Estimation**|<details><summary>Show Abstract</summary><p>Transformer-based methods for 3-D human pose estimation face significant computational challenges due to the quadratic growth of self-attention mechanism complexity with sequence length. Recently, the Mamba model has substantially reduced computational overhead and demonstrated outstanding performance in modeling long sequences by leveraging state space model (SSM). However, the ability of SSM to process sequential data is not suitable for 3-D joint sequences with topological structures, and the causal convolution structure in Mamba also lacks insight into local joint relationships. To address these issues, we propose the Mamba-Driven Topology Fusion framework in this paper. Specifically, the proposed Bone Aware Module infers the direction and length of bone vectors in the spherical coordinate system, providing effective topological guidance for the Mamba model in processing joint sequences. Furthermore, we enhance the convolutional structure within the Mamba model by integrating forward and backward graph convolutional network, enabling it to better capture local joint dependencies. Finally, we design a Spatiotemporal Refinement Module to model both temporal and spatial relationships within the sequence. Through the incorporation of skeletal topology, our approach effectively alleviates Mamba's limitations in capturing human structural relationships. We conduct extensive experiments on the Human3.6M and MPI-INF-3DHP datasets for testing and comparison, and the results show that the proposed method greatly reduces computational cost while achieving higher accuracy. Ablation studies further demonstrate the effectiveness of each proposed module. The code and models will be released.</p></details>|[2505.20611](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20611)|null|
|**2025-05-28**|**HAND Me the Data: Fast Robot Adaptation via Hand Path Retrieval**|<details><summary>Show Abstract</summary><p>We hand the community HAND, a simple and time-efficient method for teaching robots new manipulation tasks through human hand demonstrations. Instead of relying on task-specific robot demonstrations collected via teleoperation, HAND uses easy-to-provide hand demonstrations to retrieve relevant behaviors from task-agnostic robot play data. Using a visual tracking pipeline, HAND extracts the motion of the human hand from the hand demonstration and retrieves robot sub-trajectories in two stages: first filtering by visual similarity, then retrieving trajectories with similar behaviors to the hand. Fine-tuning a policy on the retrieved data enables real-time learning of tasks in under four minutes, without requiring calibrated cameras or detailed hand pose estimation. Experiments also show that HAND outperforms retrieval baselines by over 2x in average task success rates on real robots.

|**2025-05-22**|**Towards Texture- And Shape-Independent 3D Keypoint Estimation in Birds**|<details><summary>Show Abstract</summary><p>In this paper, we present a texture-independent approach to estimate and track 3D joint positions of multiple pigeons. For this purpose, we build upon the existing 3D-MuPPET framework, which estimates and tracks the 3D poses of up to 10 pigeons using a multi-view camera setup. We extend this framework by using a segmentation method that generates silhouettes of the individuals, which are then used to estimate 2D keypoints. Following 3D-MuPPET, these 2D keypoints are triangulated to infer 3D poses, and identities are matched in the first frame and tracked in 2D across subsequent frames. Our proposed texture-independent approach achieves comparable accuracy to the original texture-dependent 3D-MuPPET framework. Additionally, we explore our approach's applicability to other bird species. To do that, we infer the 2D joint positions of four bird species without additional fine-tuning the model trained on pigeons and obtain preliminary promising results. Thus, we think that our approach serves as a solid foundation and inspires the development of more robust and accurate texture-independent pose estimation frameworks.</p></details>|[2505.16633](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16633)|null|
|**2025-05-22**|**GMatch: Geometry-Constrained Feature Matching for RGB-D Object Pose Estimation**|<details><summary>Show Abstract</summary><p>We present GMatch, a learning-free feature matcher designed for robust 6DoF object pose estimation, addressing common local ambiguities in sparse feature matching. Unlike traditional methods that rely solely on descriptor similarity, GMatch performs a guided, incremental search, enforcing SE(3)-invariant geometric consistency throughout the matching process. It leverages a provably complete set of geometric features that uniquely determine 3D keypoint configurations, ensuring globally consistent correspondences without the need for training or GPU support. When combined with classical descriptors such as SIFT, GMatch-SIFT forms a general-purpose pose estimation pipeline that offers strong interpretability and generalization across diverse objects and scenes. Experiments on the HOPE dataset show that GMatch outperforms both traditional and learning-based matchers, with GMatch-SIFT achieving or surpassing the performance of instance-level pose networks. On the YCB-Video dataset, GMatch-SIFT demonstrates high accuracy and low variance on texture-rich objects. These results not only validate the effectiveness of GMatch-SIFT for object pose estimation but also highlight the broader applicability of GMatch as a general-purpose feature matcher. Code will be released upon acceptance.</p></details>|[2505.16144](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16144)|null|
|**2025-05-21**|**Object-Focus Actor for Data-efficient Robot Generalization Dexterous Manipulation**|<details><summary>Show Abstract</summary><p>Robot manipulation learning from human demonstrations offers a rapid means to acquire skills but often lacks generalization across diverse scenes and object placements. This limitation hinders real-world applications, particularly in complex tasks requiring dexterous manipulation. Vision-Language-Action (VLA) paradigm leverages large-scale data to enhance generalization. However, due to data scarcity, VLA's performance remains limited. In this work, we introduce Object-Focus Actor (OFA), a novel, data-efficient approach for generalized dexterous manipulation. OFA exploits the consistent end trajectories observed in dexterous manipulation tasks, allowing for efficient policy training. Our method employs a hierarchical pipeline: object perception and pose estimation, pre-manipulation pose arrival and OFA policy execution. This process ensures that the manipulation is focused and efficient, even in varied backgrounds and positional layout. Comprehensive real-world experiments across seven tasks demonstrate that OFA significantly outperforms baseline methods in both positional and background generalization tests. Notably, OFA achieves robust performance with only 10 demonstrations, highlighting its data efficiency.</p></details>|[2505.15098](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15098)|null|
|**2025-05-20**|**UPTor: Unified 3D Human Pose Dynamics and Trajectory Prediction for Human-Robot Interaction**|<details><summary>Show Abstract</summary><p>We introduce a unified approach to forecast the dynamics of human keypoints along with the motion trajectory based on a short sequence of input poses. While many studies address either full-body pose prediction or motion trajectory prediction, only a few attempt to merge them. We propose a motion transformation technique to simultaneously predict full-body pose and trajectory key-points in a global coordinate frame. We utilize an off-the-shelf 3D human pose estimation module, a graph attention network to encode the skeleton structure, and a compact, non-autoregressive transformer suitable for real-time motion prediction for human-robot interaction and human-aware navigation. We introduce a human navigation dataset ``DARKO'' with specific focus on navigational activities that are relevant for human-aware mobile robot navigation. We perform extensive evaluation on Human3.6M, CMU-Mocap, and our DARKO dataset. In comparison to prior work, we show that our approach is compact, real-time, and accurate in predicting human navigation motion across all datasets.

|**2025-05-19**|**Recollection from Pensieve: Novel View Synthesis via Learning from Uncalibrated Videos**|<details><summary>Show Abstract</summary><p>Currently almost all state-of-the-art novel view synthesis and reconstruction models rely on calibrated cameras or additional geometric priors for training. These prerequisites significantly limit their applicability to massive uncalibrated data. To alleviate this requirement and unlock the potential for self-supervised training on large-scale uncalibrated videos, we propose a novel two-stage strategy to train a view synthesis model from only raw video frames or multi-view images, without providing camera parameters or other priors. In the first stage, we learn to reconstruct the scene implicitly in a latent space without relying on any explicit 3D representation. Specifically, we predict per-frame latent camera and scene context features, and employ a view synthesis model as a proxy for explicit rendering. This pretraining stage substantially reduces the optimization complexity and encourages the network to learn the underlying 3D consistency in a self-supervised manner. The learned latent camera and implicit scene representation have a large gap compared with the real 3D world. To reduce this gap, we introduce the second stage training by explicitly predicting 3D Gaussian primitives. We additionally apply explicit Gaussian Splatting rendering loss and depth projection loss to align the learned latent representations with physically grounded 3D geometry. In this way, Stage 1 provides a strong initialization and Stage 2 enforces 3D consistency - the two stages are complementary and mutually beneficial. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, achieving high-quality novel view synthesis and accurate camera pose estimation, compared to methods that employ supervision with calibration, pose, or depth information. The code is available at https://github.com/Dwawayu/Pensieve.</p></details>|[2505.13440](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13440)|**[link](https://github.com/dwawayu/pensieve)**|

While emerging technologies are making it easier to capture kinematics with biomechanical models, or how joint angles change over time, inferring the underlying physics that give rise to these movements, including ground reaction forces, joint torques, or even muscle activations, is still challenging. Here we explore whether imitation learning applied to a biomechanical model from a large dataset of movements from able-bodied and impaired individuals can learn to compute these inverse dynamics. Although imitation learning in human pose estimation has seen great interest in recent years, our work differences in several ways: we focus on using an accurate biomechanical model instead of models adopted for computer vision, we test it on a dataset that contains participants with impaired movements, we reported detailed tracking metrics relevant for the clinical measurement of movement including joint angles and ground contact events, and finally we apply imitation learning to a muscle-driven neuromusculoskeletal model. We show that our imitation learning policy, KinTwin, can accurately replicate the kinematics of a wide range of movements, including those with assistive devices or therapist assistance, and that it can infer clinically meaningful differences in joint torques and muscle activations. Our work demonstrates the potential for using imitation learning to enable high-quality movement analysis in clinical practice.</p></details>|[2505.13436](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13436)|null|

However, no climbing dataset with detailed hold usage annotations exists to our knowledge. To address this issue, we introduce a dataset of 22 annotated climbing videos, providing ground-truth labels for hold locations, usage order, and time of use. Furthermore, we explore the application of keypoint-based 2D pose-estimation models for detecting hold usage in sport climbing. We determine usage by analyzing the key points of certain joints and the corresponding overlap with climbing holds. We evaluate multiple state-of-the-art models and analyze their accuracy on our dataset, identifying and highlighting climbing-specific challenges. Our dataset and results highlight key challenges in climbing-specific pose estimation and establish a foundation for future research toward AI-assisted systems for sports climbing.</p></details>|[2505.12854](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12854)|null|
|**2025-05-17**|**Keypoints as Dynamic Centroids for Unified Human Pose and Segmentation**|<details><summary>Show Abstract</summary><p>The dynamic movement of the human body presents a fundamental challenge for human pose estimation and body segmentation. State-of-the-art approaches primarily rely on combining keypoint heatmaps with segmentation masks but often struggle in scenarios involving overlapping joints or rapidly changing poses during instance-level segmentation. To address these limitations, we propose Keypoints as Dynamic Centroid (KDC), a new centroid-based representation for unified human pose estimation and instance-level segmentation. KDC adopts a bottom-up paradigm to generate keypoint heatmaps for both easily distinguishable and complex keypoints and improves keypoint detection and confidence scores by introducing KeyCentroids using a keypoint disk. It leverages high-confidence keypoints as dynamic centroids in the embedding space to generate MaskCentroids, allowing for swift clustering of pixels to specific human instances during rapid body movements in live environments. Our experimental evaluations on the CrowdPose, OCHuman, and COCO benchmarks demonstrate KDC's effectiveness and generalizability in challenging scenarios in terms of both accuracy and runtime performance.

However, most existing EHPS models focus primarily on minimizing estimation errors, with limited attention on potential security vulnerabilities. Current adversarial attacks on EHPS models often require white-box access (e.g., model details or gradients) or generate visually conspicuous perturbations, limiting their practicality and ability to expose real-world security threats. To address these limitations, we propose a novel Unnoticeable Black-Box Attack (UBA) against EHPS models. UBA leverages the latent-space representations of natural images to generate an optimal adversarial noise pattern and iteratively refine its attack potency along an optimized direction in digital space. Crucially, this process relies solely on querying the model's output, requiring no internal knowledge of the EHPS architecture, while guiding the noise optimization toward greater stealth and effectiveness. Extensive experiments and visual analyses demonstrate the superiority of UBA. Notably, UBA increases the pose estimation errors of EHPS models by 17.27%-58.21% on average, revealing critical vulnerabilities. These findings underscore the urgent need to address and mitigate security risks associated with digital human generation systems.</p></details>|[2505.12009](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12009)|null|

While traditional marker-based methods offer accuracy, they face challenges with occlusions, reflections, and tool-specific designs. Similarly, supervised learning methods require extensive training on annotated datasets, limiting their adaptability to new tools. Despite their success in other domains, zero-shot pose estimation models remain unexplored in RMIS for pose estimation of surgical instruments, creating a gap in generalising to unseen surgical tools. This paper presents a novel 6 Degrees of Freedom (DoF) pose estimation pipeline for surgical instruments, leveraging state-of-the-art zero-shot RGB-D models like the FoundationPose and SAM-6D. We advanced these models by incorporating vision-based depth estimation using the RAFT-Stereo method, for robust depth estimation in reflective and textureless environments. Additionally, we enhanced SAM-6D by replacing its instance segmentation module, Segment Anything Model (SAM), with a fine-tuned Mask R-CNN, significantly boosting segmentation accuracy in occluded and complex conditions. Extensive validation reveals that our enhanced SAM-6D surpasses FoundationPose in zero-shot pose estimation of unseen surgical instruments, setting a new benchmark for zero-shot RGB-D pose estimation in RMIS. This work enhances the generalisability of pose estimation for unseen objects and pioneers the application of RGB-D zero-shot methods in RMIS.</p></details>|[2505.11439](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11439)|null|

However, effectively utilizing such speeds remains a challenge due to the limitations of RGB cameras, which suffer from motion blur and fail to provide real-time responsiveness. Event cameras, with their asynchronous operation, and low-latency sensing, offer a promising alternative for high-speed robotic perception. In this work, we introduce MTevent, a dataset designed for 6D pose estimation and moving object detection in highly dynamic environments with large detection distances. Our setup consists of a stereo-event camera and an RGB camera, capturing 75 scenes, each on average 16 seconds, and featuring 16 unique objects under challenging conditions such as extreme viewing angles, varying lighting, and occlusions. MTevent is the first dataset to combine high-speed motion, long-range perception, and real-world object interactions, making it a valuable resource for advancing event-based vision in robotics. To establish a baseline, we evaluate the task of 6D pose estimation using NVIDIA's FoundationPose on RGB images, achieving an Average Recall of 0.22 with ground-truth masks, highlighting the limitations of RGB-based approaches in such dynamic settings. With MTevent, we provide a novel resource to improve perception models and foster further research in high-speed robotic vision.

In practice, however, systems must adapt to diverse viewpoints, environments, and camera setups -- conditions that differ significantly from those encountered during training, which is often the case in real-world scenarios. To address these challenges, we present a standardized testing environment in which each method is evaluated on a variety of datasets, ensuring consistent and fair cross-dataset comparisons -- allowing for the analysis of methods on previously unseen data. Therefore, we propose PoseBench3D, a unified framework designed to systematically re-evaluate prior and future models across four of the most widely used datasets for human pose estimation -- with the framework able to support novel and future datasets as the field progresses. Through a unified interface, our framework provides datasets in a pre-configured yet easily modifiable format, ensuring compatibility with diverse model architectures.

To tackle this issue, we propose RefPose, an innovative approach to object pose estimation that leverages a reference image and geometric correspondence as guidance. RefPose first predicts an initial pose by using object templates to render the reference image and establish the geometric correspondence needed for the refinement stage. During the refinement stage, RefPose estimates the geometric correspondence of the query based on the generated references and iteratively refines the pose through a render-and-compare approach. To enhance this estimation, we introduce a correlation volume-guided attention mechanism that effectively captures correlations between the query and reference images. Unlike traditional methods that depend on pre-defined object models, RefPose dynamically adapts to new object shapes by leveraging a reference image and geometric correspondence. This results in robust performance across previously unseen objects. Extensive evaluation on the BOP benchmark datasets shows that RefPose achieves state-of-the-art results while maintaining a competitive runtime.</p></details>|[2505.10841](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10841)|null|
|**2025-05-14**|**UMotion: Uncertainty-driven Human Motion Estimation from Inertial and Ultra-wideband Units**|<details><summary>Show Abstract</summary><p>Sparse wearable inertial measurement units (IMUs) have gained popularity for estimating 3D human motion. However, challenges such as pose ambiguity, data drift, and limited adaptability to diverse bodies persist. To address these issues, we propose UMotion, an uncertainty-driven, online fusing-all state estimation framework for 3D human shape and pose estimation, supported by six integrated, body-worn ultra-wideband (UWB) distance sensors with IMUs. UWB sensors measure inter-node distances to infer spatial relationships, aiding in resolving pose ambiguities and body shape variations when combined with anthropometric data. Unfortunately, IMUs are prone to drift, and UWB sensors are affected by body occlusions. Consequently, we develop a tightly coupled Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF) framework that fuses uncertainties from sensor data and estimated human motion based on individual body shape. The UKF iteratively refines IMU and UWB measurements by aligning them with uncertain human motion constraints in real-time, producing optimal estimates for each. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of UMotion in stabilizing sensor data and the improvement over state of the art in pose accuracy.</p></details>|[2505.09393](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09393)|**[link](https://github.com/kk9six/umotion)**|

Poor localization accuracy is often a consequence of inaccurate initial poses, particularly noticeable in GNSS-denied environments where GPS signals are primarily relied upon for initialization. Recent advances in leveraging deep neural networks for pose regression have led to significant improvements in both accuracy and robustness, especially in estimating complex spatial relationships and orientations. In this paper, we introduce APR-Transformer, a model architecture inspired by state-of-the-art methods, which predicts absolute pose (3D position and 3D orientation) using either image or LiDAR data. We demonstrate that our proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance on established benchmark datasets such as the Radar Oxford Robot-Car and DeepLoc datasets. Furthermore, we extend our experiments to include our custom complex APR-BeIntelli dataset. Additionally, we validate the reliability of our approach in GNSS-denied environments by deploying the model in real-time on an autonomous test vehicle. This showcases the practical feasibility and effectiveness of our approach.

However, implementing accurate autonomous control can be difficult due to poor end-effector proprioception, a limitation of their cable-driven mechanisms. Although the robot may have joint encoders for the end-effector pose calculation, various non-idealities make the entire kinematics chain inaccurate. Modern vision-based pose estimation methods lack real-time capability or can be hard to train and generalize. In this work, we demonstrate a real-time capable, vision transformer-based pose estimation approach that is trained using end-to-end differentiable kinematics and rendering in simulation. We demonstrate the potential of this method to correct for noisy pose estimates in simulation, with the longer term goal of verifying the sim-to-real transferability of our approach.</p></details>|[2505.08875](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08875)|null|

We focus on four-way sleep position classification using data collected from a PSM placed under a mattress in a sleep clinic. Sleep positions can affect sleep quality and the prevalence of sleep disorders, such as apnea. Measurements were performed on patients with suspected sleep disorders referred for assessments at a sleep clinic. Training deep learning models can be challenging in clinical settings due to the need for large amounts of labeled data. To overcome the shortage of labeled training data, we utilize transfer learning to adapt pre-trained deep learning models to accurately estimate sleep positions from a low-resolution PSM dataset collected in a polysomnography sleep lab. Our approach leverages Vision Transformer models pre-trained on ImageNet using masked autoencoding (ViTMAE) and a pre-trained model for human pose estimation (ViTPose). These approaches outperform previous work from PSM-based sleep pose classification using deep learning (TCN) as well as traditional machine learning models (SVM, XGBoost, Random Forest) that use engineered features. We evaluate the performance of sleep position classification from 112 nights of patient recordings and validate it on a higher resolution 13-patient dataset. Despite the challenges of differentiating between sleep positions from low-resolution PSM data, our approach shows promise for real-world deployment in clinical settings</p></details>|[2505.08111](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08111)|null|

Ergonomic assessments can mitigate these risks by identifying workplace adjustments that improve posture and reduce strain. Camera-based systems offer a non-intrusive, cost-effective method for continuous ergonomic tracking, but they also raise significant privacy concerns. To address this, we propose a privacy-aware ergonomic assessment framework utilizing machine learning techniques. Our approach employs adversarial training to develop a lightweight neural network that obfuscates video data, preserving only the essential information needed for human pose estimation. This obfuscation ensures compatibility with standard pose estimation algorithms, maintaining high accuracy while protecting privacy. The obfuscated video data is transmitted to a central server, where state-of-the-art keypoint detection algorithms extract body landmarks. Using multi-view integration, 3D keypoints are reconstructed and evaluated with the Rapid Entire Body Assessment (REBA) method. Our system provides a secure, effective solution for ergonomic monitoring in industrial environments, addressing both privacy and workplace safety concerns.</p></details>|[2505.07306](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07306)|null|

This becomes particularly challenging in perception-degraded subterranean conditions under harsh environmental factors, including darkness, dust, and geometrically self-similar structures. This paper details CompSLAM, a highly resilient and hierarchical multi-modal localization and mapping framework designed to address these challenges. Its flexible architecture achieves resilience through redundancy by leveraging the complementary nature of pose estimates derived from diverse sensor modalities.

Furthermore, it has proven to be a reliable odometry and mapping solution in various subsequent projects, with extensions enabling multi-robot map sharing for marsupial robotic deployments and collaborative mapping. This paper also introduces a comprehensive dataset acquired by a manually teleoperated quadrupedal robot, covering a significant portion of the DARPA Subterranean Challenge finals course.

In robotics, active tactile perception has emerged as an important research domain that complements vision for tasks such as object classification, shape reconstruction, and manipulation. This work introduces TAP (Task-agnostic Active Perception) -- a novel framework that leverages reinforcement learning (RL) and transformer-based architectures to address the challenges posed by partially observable environments. TAP integrates Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) and CrossQ algorithms within a unified optimization objective, jointly training a perception module and decision-making policy. By design, TAP is completely task-agnostic and can, in principle, generalize to any active perception problem. We evaluate TAP across diverse tasks, including toy examples and realistic applications involving haptic exploration of 3D models from the Tactile MNIST benchmark. Experiments demonstrate the efficacy of TAP, achieving high accuracies on the Tactile MNIST haptic digit recognition task and a tactile pose estimation task.

Compared to vision-based systems, full-body pose estimation from sparse tracking signals is not limited by environmental conditions or recording range. However, previous works either face the challenge of wearing additional sensors on the pelvis and lower-body or rely on external visual sensors to obtain global positions of key joints. To improve the practicality of the technology for virtual reality applications, we estimate full-body poses using only inertial data obtained from three Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) sensors worn on the head and wrists, thereby reducing the complexity of the hardware system. In this work, we propose a method called Progressive Inertial Poser (ProgIP) for human pose estimation, which combines neural network estimation with a human dynamics model, considers the hierarchical structure of the kinematic chain, and employs a multi-stage progressive network estimation with increased depth to reconstruct full-body motion in real time. The encoder combines Transformer Encoder and bidirectional LSTM (TE-biLSTM) to flexibly capture the temporal dependencies of the inertial sequence, while the decoder based on multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) transforms high-dimensional features and accurately projects them onto Skinned Multi-Person Linear (SMPL) model parameters. Quantitative and qualitative experimental results on multiple public datasets show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods with the same inputs, and is comparable to recent works using six IMU sensors.</p></details>|[2505.05336](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05336)|null|

However, human global motions are still challenging to be reconstructed by IMUs. This paper aims to solve this problem by involving physics. It proposes a physical optimization scheme based on multiple contacts to enable physically plausible translation estimation in the full 3D space where the z-directional motion is usually challenging for previous works. It also considers gravity in local pose estimation which well constrains human global orientations and refines local pose estimation in a joint estimation manner. Experiments demonstrate that our method achieves more accurate motion capture for both local poses and global motions. Furthermore, by deeply integrating physics, we can also estimate 3D contact, contact forces, joint torques, and interacting proxy surfaces.</p></details>|[2505.05010](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05010)|null|

Typical pose estimation methods like global point cloud registrations are prone to minor pose errors for which local registration algorithms are generally used to improve pose accuracy.

These developments have led to highly accurate body tracking systems, which have direct applications in sports analysis and performance evaluation.   This work analyzes the performance of six trackers: two point trackers and four joint trackers for biomechanical analysis in sprints. The proposed framework compares the results obtained from these pose trackers with the manual annotations of biomechanical experts for more than 5870 frames. The experimental framework employs forty sprints from five professional runners, focusing on three key angles in sprint biomechanics: trunk inclination, hip flex extension, and knee flex extension. We propose a post-processing module for outlier detection and fusion prediction in the joint angles.   The experimental results demonstrate that using joint-based models yields root mean squared errors ranging from 11.41{\deg} to 4.37{\deg}. When integrated with the post-processing modules, these errors can be reduced to 6.99{\deg} and 3.88{\deg}, respectively. The experimental findings suggest that human pose tracking approaches can be valuable resources for the biomechanical analysis of running. However, there is still room for improvement in applications where high accuracy is required.</p></details>|[2505.04713](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04713)|null|

At the cost of ever-increasing computational load and sensor complexity, odometry algorithms have reached impressive levels of accuracy with minimal drift in various conditions. In this paper, we question the need for more research on odometry for autonomous driving by assessing the accuracy of one of the simplest algorithms: the direct integration of wheel encoder data and yaw rate measurements from a gyroscope. We denote this algorithm as Odometer-Gyroscope (OG) odometry. This work shows that OG odometry can outperform current state-of-the-art radar-inertial SE(2) odometry for a fraction of the computational cost in most scenarios. For example, the OG odometry is on top of the Boreas leaderboard with a relative translation error of 0.20%, while the second-best method displays an error of 0.26%. Lidar-inertial approaches can provide more accurate estimates, but the computational load is three orders of magnitude higher than the OG odometry. To further the analysis, we have pushed the limits of the OG odometry by purposely violating its fundamental no-slip assumption using data collected during a heavy snowstorm with different driving behaviours. Our conclusion shows that a significant amount of slippage is required to result in non-satisfactory pose estimates from the OG odometry.</p></details>|[2505.04438](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04438)|null|

These requirements make generalization to novel objects difficult for which neither 3D models nor multi-view images may be available. To address this, we propose a novel method One2Any that estimates the relative 6-degrees of freedom (DOF) object pose using only a single reference-single query RGB-D image, without prior knowledge of its 3D model, multi-view data, or category constraints. We treat object pose estimation as an encoding-decoding process, first, we obtain a comprehensive Reference Object Pose Embedding (ROPE) that encodes an object shape, orientation, and texture from a single reference view. Using this embedding, a U-Net-based pose decoding module produces Reference Object Coordinate (ROC) for new views, enabling fast and accurate pose estimation. This simple encoding-decoding framework allows our model to be trained on any pair-wise pose data, enabling large-scale training and demonstrating great scalability.

While deep learning-based human pose estimation (HPE) models from RGB videos have achieved impressive performance on public datasets, their effectiveness in real-world sports scenarios is often hindered by motion blur, occlusions, and domain shifts across different pose representations. Fine-tuning these models can partially alleviate such challenges but typically requires large-scale annotated data and still struggles to generalize across diverse sports environments. To address these limitations, we propose a 2D pose prior-guided refinement approach based on Neural Distance Fields (NDF). Unlike existing approaches that rely solely on angular representations of human poses, we introduce a polar coordinate-based representation that explicitly incorporates joint connection lengths, enabling a more accurate correction of erroneous pose estimations. Additionally, we define a novel non-geodesic distance metric that separates angular and radial discrepancies, which we demonstrate is better suited for polar representations than traditional geodesic distances. To mitigate data scarcity, we develop a gradient-based batch-projection augmentation strategy, which synthesizes realistic pose samples through iterative refinement. Our method is evaluated on a long jump dataset, demonstrating its ability to improve 2D pose estimation across multiple pose representations, making it robust across different domains. Experimental results show that our approach enhances pose plausibility while requiring only limited training data.

Existing methods often overlook the translation information between each pair of viewpoints, leading to suboptimal performance in sparse-view scenarios. To address this limitation, we introduce T-Graph, a lightweight, plug-and-play module to enhance camera pose estimation in sparse-view settings. T-graph takes paired image features as input and maps them through a Multilayer Perceptron (MLP). It then constructs a fully connected translation graph, where nodes represent cameras and edges encode their translation relationships. It can be seamlessly integrated into existing models as an additional branch in parallel with the original prediction, maintaining efficiency and ease of use. Furthermore, we introduce two pairwise translation representations, relative-t and pair-t, formulated under different local coordinate systems. While relative-t captures intuitive spatial relationships, pair-t offers a rotation-disentangled alternative. The two representations contribute to enhanced adaptability across diverse application scenarios, further improving our module's robustness. Extensive experiments on two state-of-the-art methods (RelPose++ and Forge) using public datasets (C03D and IMC PhotoTourism) validate both the effectiveness and generalizability of T-Graph. The results demonstrate consistent improvements across various metrics, notably camera center accuracy, which improves by 1% to 6% from 2 to 8 viewpoints.</p></details>|[2505.01207](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01207)|null|

However, Transformer-based methods either ignore the spatial neighborhood relationships between the joints when used for skeleton representations or disregard the local temporal patterns of the local joint movements in skeleton sequence modeling, while GCN-based methods often neglect the need for pose-specific representations. To address these problems, we propose a new method that exploits the graph modeling capability of GCN to represent each skeleton with multiple graphs of different orders, incorporated with a newly introduced Graph Order Attention module that dynamically emphasizes the most representative orders for each joint. The resulting spatial features of the sequence are further processed using a proposed temporal Body Aware Transformer that models the global body feature dependencies in the sequence with awareness of the local inter-skeleton feature dependencies of joints. Given that our 3D pose output aligns with the central 2D pose in the sequence, we improve the self-attention mechanism to be aware of the central pose while diminishing its focus gradually towards the first and the last poses. Extensive experiments on Human3.6m, MPIINF-3DHP, and HumanEva-I datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

The common approach to relative pose estimation is to apply a minimal solver inside a RANSAC loop. Highly efficient solvers exist for pinhole cameras. Yet, (nearly) all cameras exhibit radial distortion. Not modeling radial distortion leads to (significantly) worse results. However, minimal radial distortion solvers are significantly more complex than pinhole solvers, both in terms of run-time and implementation efforts. This paper compares radial distortion solvers with two simple-to-implement approaches that do not use minimal radial distortion solvers: The first approach combines an efficient pinhole solver with sampled radial undistortion parameters, where the sampled parameters are used for undistortion prior to applying the pinhole solver. The second approach uses a state-of-the-art neural network to estimate the distortion parameters rather than sampling them from a set of potential values. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets, and different camera setups, show that complex minimal radial distortion solvers are not necessary in practice. We discuss under which conditions a simple sampling of radial undistortion parameters is preferable over calibrating cameras using a learning-based prior approach.

|**2025-05-01**|**Dietary Intake Estimation via Continuous 3D Reconstruction of Food**|<details><summary>Show Abstract</summary><p>Monitoring dietary habits is crucial for preventing health risks associated with overeating and undereating, including obesity, diabetes, and cardiovascular diseases. Traditional methods for tracking food intake rely on self-reported data before or after the eating, which are prone to inaccuracies. This study proposes an approach to accurately monitor ingest behaviours by leveraging 3D food models constructed from monocular 2D video. Using COLMAP and pose estimation algorithms, we generate detailed 3D representations of food, allowing us to observe changes in food volume as it is consumed. Experiments with toy models and real food items demonstrate the approach's potential. Meanwhile, we have proposed a new methodology for automated state recognition challenges to accurately detect state changes and maintain model fidelity. The 3D reconstruction approach shows promise in capturing comprehensive dietary behaviour insights, ultimately contributing to the development of automated and accurate dietary monitoring tools.</p></details>|[2505.00606](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00606)|null|
|**2025-05-02**|**InterLoc: LiDAR-based Intersection Localization using Road Segmentation with Automated Evaluation Method**|<details><summary>Show Abstract</summary><p>Online localization of road intersections is beneficial for autonomous vehicle localization, mapping and motion planning. Intersections offer strong landmarks to correct vehicle pose estimation in GNSS dropouts and anchor new sensor data in up-to-date maps. They are also decisive routing nodes in road network graphs. Despite that importance, intersection localization has not been widely studied, with existing methods either ignore the rich semantic information already computed onboard or depend on scarce, hand-labeled intersection datasets. To close that gap, this paper presents a LiDAR-based method for online vehicle-centric intersection localization. We fuse semantic road segmentation with vehicle local pose to detect intersection candidates in a bird's eye view (BEV) representation. We then refine those candidates by analyzing branch topology and correcting the intersection point in a least squares formulation. To evaluate our method, we introduce an automated benchmarking pipeline that pairs localized intersection points with OpenStreetMap (OSM) intersection nodes using precise GNSS/INS ground-truth poses. Experiments on SemanticKITTI show that the method outperforms the latest learning-based baseline in accuracy and reliability. Moreover, sensitivity tests demonstrate that our method is robust to challenging segmentation error levels, highlighting its applicability in the real world.</p></details>|[2505.00512](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00512)|null|
|**2025-04-30**|**Self-Supervised Monocular Visual Drone Model Identification through Improved Occlusion Handling**|<details><summary>Show Abstract</summary><p>Ego-motion estimation is vital for drones when flying in GPS-denied environments. Vision-based methods struggle when flight speed increases and close-by objects lead to difficult visual conditions with considerable motion blur and large occlusions. To tackle this, vision is typically complemented by state estimation filters that combine a drone model with inertial measurements. However, these drone models are currently learned in a supervised manner with ground-truth data from external motion capture systems, limiting scalability to different environments and drones. In this work, we propose a self-supervised learning scheme to train a neural-network-based drone model using only onboard monocular video and flight controller data (IMU and motor feedback). We achieve this by first training a self-supervised relative pose estimation model, which then serves as a teacher for the drone model. To allow this to work at high speed close to obstacles, we propose an improved occlusion handling method for training self-supervised pose estimation models. Due to this method, the root mean squared error of resulting odometry estimates is reduced by an average of 15%. Moreover, the student neural drone model can be successfully obtained from the onboard data. It even becomes more accurate at higher speeds compared to its teacher, the self-supervised vision-based model. We demonstrate the value of the neural drone model by integrating it into a traditional filter-based VIO system (ROVIO), resulting in superior odometry accuracy on aggressive 3D racing trajectories near obstacles. Self-supervised learning of ego-motion estimation represents a significant step toward bridging the gap between flying in controlled, expensive lab environments and real-world drone applications. The fusion of vision and drone models will enable higher-speed flight and improve state estimation, on any drone in any environment.</p></details>|[2504.21695](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21695)|null|
|**2025-04-29**|**Dance Style Recognition Using Laban Movement Analysis**|<details><summary>Show Abstract</summary><p>The growing interest in automated movement analysis has presented new challenges in recognition of complex human activities including dance. This study focuses on dance style recognition using features extracted using Laban Movement Analysis. Previous studies for dance style recognition often focus on cross-frame movement analysis, which limits the ability to capture temporal context and dynamic transitions between movements. This gap highlights the need for a method that can add temporal context to LMA features. For this, we introduce a novel pipeline which combines 3D pose estimation, 3D human mesh reconstruction, and floor aware body modeling to effectively extract LMA features. To address the temporal limitation, we propose a sliding window approach that captures movement evolution across time in features. These features are then used to train various machine learning methods for classification, and their explainability explainable AI methods to evaluate the contribution of each feature to classification performance. Our proposed method achieves a highest classification accuracy of 99.18\% which shows that the addition of temporal context significantly improves dance style recognition performance.</p></details>|[2504.21166](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21166)|null|

However, previous research studied these human-centric tasks individually, whose performance is largely limited to the size of the public task-specific datasets. Recent human-centric methods leverage the additional modalities, e.g., depth, to learn fine-grained semantic information, which limits the benefit of pretraining models due to their sensitivity to camera views and the scarcity of RGB-D data on the Internet. This paper improves the data scalability of human-centric pretraining methods by discarding depth information and exploring semantic information of RGB images in the frequency space by Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT). We further propose new annotation denoising auxiliary tasks with keypoints and DCT maps to enforce the RGB image extractor to learn fine-grained semantic information of human bodies. Our extensive experiments show that when pretrained on large-scale datasets (COCO and AIC datasets) without depth annotation, our model achieves better performance than state-of-the-art methods by +0.5 mAP on COCO, +1.4 PCKh on MPII and -0.51 EPE on Human3.6M for pose estimation, by +4.50 mIoU on Human3.6M for human parsing, by -3.14 MAE on SHA and -0.07 MAE on SHB for crowd counting, by +1.1 F1 score on SHA and +0.8 F1 score on SHA for crowd localization, and by +0.1 mAP on Market1501 and +0.8 mAP on MSMT for person ReID.

|**2025-04-29**|**Large-scale visual SLAM for in-the-wild videos**|<details><summary>Show Abstract</summary><p>Accurate and robust 3D scene reconstruction from casual, in-the-wild videos can significantly simplify robot deployment to new environments. However, reliable camera pose estimation and scene reconstruction from such unconstrained videos remains an open challenge. Existing visual-only SLAM methods perform well on benchmark datasets but struggle with real-world footage which often exhibits uncontrolled motion including rapid rotations and pure forward movements, textureless regions, and dynamic objects. We analyze the limitations of current methods and introduce a robust pipeline designed to improve 3D reconstruction from casual videos. We build upon recent deep visual odometry methods but increase robustness in several ways. Camera intrinsics are automatically recovered from the first few frames using structure-from-motion. Dynamic objects and less-constrained areas are masked with a predictive model. Additionally, we leverage monocular depth estimates to regularize bundle adjustment, mitigating errors in low-parallax situations. Finally, we integrate place recognition and loop closure to reduce long-term drift and refine both intrinsics and pose estimates through global bundle adjustment. We demonstrate large-scale contiguous 3D models from several online videos in various environments. In contrast, baseline methods typically produce locally inconsistent results at several points, producing separate segments or distorted maps. In lieu of ground-truth pose data, we evaluate map consistency, execution time and visual accuracy of re-rendered NeRF models. Our proposed system establishes a new baseline for visual reconstruction from casual uncontrolled videos found online, demonstrating more consistent reconstructions over longer sequences of in-the-wild videos than previously achieved.</p></details>|[2504.20496](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20496)|null|

First, the method uses 3DGS to render a synthetic RGBD image at some initial pose estimate. Second, it establishes 2D-2D correspondences between the query image and this synthetic image. Third, it uses the depth map to lift the 2D-2D correspondences to 2D-3D correspondences and solves a perspective-n-point (PnP) problem to produce a final pose estimate. Results from evaluation across three existing datasets with 38 scenes and over 2,700 test images show that our method significantly reduces both inference time (by over two orders of magnitude, from more than 10 seconds to as fast as 0.1 seconds) and estimation error compared to baseline methods that use photometric loss minimization. Results also show that our method tolerates large errors in the initial pose estimate of up to 55{\deg} in rotation and 1.1 units in translation (normalized by scene scale), achieving final pose errors of less than 5{\deg} in rotation and 0.05 units in translation on 90% of images from the Synthetic NeRF and Mip-NeRF360 datasets and on 42% of images from the more challenging Tanks and Temples dataset.</p></details>|[2504.20379](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20379)|null|
|**2025-04-29**|**PRISM-DP: Spatial Pose-based Observations for Diffusion-Policies via Segmentation, Mesh Generation, and Pose Tracking**|<details><summary>Show Abstract</summary><p>Diffusion-based visuomotor policies generate robot motions by learning to denoise action-space trajectories conditioned on observations. These observations are commonly streams of RGB images, whose high dimensionality includes substantial task-irrelevant information, requiring large models to extract relevant patterns. In contrast, using more structured observations, such as the spatial poses (positions and orientations) of key objects over time, enables training more compact policies that can recognize relevant patterns with fewer parameters. However, obtaining accurate object poses in open-set, real-world environments remains challenging. For instance, it is impractical to assume that all relevant objects are equipped with markers, and recent learning-based 6D pose estimation and tracking methods often depend on pre-scanned object meshes, requiring manual reconstruction. In this work, we propose PRISM-DP, an approach that leverages segmentation, mesh generation, pose estimation, and pose tracking models to enable compact diffusion policy learning directly from the spatial poses of task-relevant objects. Crucially, because PRISM-DP uses a mesh generation model, it eliminates the need for manual mesh processing or creation, improving scalability and usability in open-set, real-world environments. Experiments across a range of tasks in both simulation and real-world settings show that PRISM-DP outperforms high-dimensional image-based diffusion policies and achieves performance comparable to policies trained with ground-truth state information. We conclude with a discussion of the broader implications and limitations of our approach.</p></details>|[2504.20359](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20359)|null|
|**2025-04-28**|**Transformation & Translation Occupancy Grid Mapping: 2-Dimensional Deep Learning Refined SLAM**|<details><summary>Show Abstract</summary><p>SLAM (Simultaneous Localisation and Mapping) is a crucial component for robotic systems, providing a map of an environment, the current location and previous trajectory of a robot. While 3D LiDAR SLAM has received notable improvements in recent years, 2D SLAM lags behind. Gradual drifts in odometry and pose estimation inaccuracies hinder modern 2D LiDAR-odometry algorithms in large complex environments. Dynamic robotic motion coupled with inherent estimation based SLAM processes introduce noise and errors, degrading map quality. Occupancy Grid Mapping (OGM) produces results that are often noisy and unclear. This is due to the fact that evidence based mapping represents maps according to uncertain observations. This is why OGMs are so popular in exploration or navigation tasks. However, this also limits OGMs' effectiveness for specific mapping based tasks such as floor plan creation in complex scenes. To address this, we propose our novel Transformation and Translation Occupancy Grid Mapping (TT-OGM). We adapt and enable accurate and robust pose estimation techniques from 3D SLAM to the world of 2D and mitigate errors to improve map quality using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). We introduce a novel data generation method via deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to build datasets large enough for training a GAN for SLAM error correction. We demonstrate our SLAM in real-time on data collected at Loughborough University. We also prove its generalisability on a variety of large complex environments on a collection of large scale well-known 2D occupancy maps. Our novel approach enables the creation of high quality OGMs in complex scenes, far surpassing the capabilities of current SLAM algorithms in terms of quality, accuracy and reliability.</p></details>|[2504.19654](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19654)|null|
|**2025-04-28**|**GAN-SLAM: Real-Time GAN Aided Floor Plan Creation Through SLAM**|<details><summary>Show Abstract</summary><p>SLAM is a fundamental component of modern autonomous systems, providing robots and their operators with a deeper understanding of their environment. SLAM systems often encounter challenges due to the dynamic nature of robotic motion, leading to inaccuracies in mapping quality, particularly in 2D representations such as Occupancy Grid Maps. These errors can significantly degrade map quality, hindering the effectiveness of specific downstream tasks such as floor plan creation. To address this challenge, we introduce our novel 'GAN-SLAM', a new SLAM approach that leverages Generative Adversarial Networks to clean and complete occupancy grids during the SLAM process, reducing the impact of noise and inaccuracies introduced on the output map. We adapt and integrate accurate pose estimation techniques typically used for 3D SLAM into a 2D form. This enables the quality improvement 3D LiDAR-odometry has seen in recent years to be effective for 2D representations. Our results demonstrate substantial improvements in map fidelity and quality, with minimal noise and errors, affirming the effectiveness of GAN-SLAM for real-world mapping applications within large-scale complex environments. We validate our approach on real-world data operating in real-time, and on famous examples of 2D maps. The improved quality of the output map enables new downstream tasks, such as floor plan drafting, further enhancing the capabilities of autonomous systems. Our novel approach to SLAM offers a significant step forward in the field, improving the usability for SLAM in mapping-based tasks, and offers insight into the usage of GANs for OGM error correction.</p></details>|[2504.19653](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19653)|null|

The complexity of a pose estimation task depends on the unknown variables related to the target object. While instance-level methods already excel for opaque and Lambertian objects, category-level and open-set methods, where texture, shape, and size are partially or entirely unknown, still struggle with these basic material properties. Since texture is unknown in these scenarios, it cannot be used for disambiguating object symmetries, another core challenge of 6D object pose estimation. The complexity of estimating 6D poses with such a manifold of unknowns led to various datasets, accuracy metrics, and algorithmic solutions. This paper compares datasets, accuracy metrics, and algorithms for solving 6D pose estimation on the category-level. Based on this comparison, we analyze how to bridge category-level and open-set object pose estimation to reach generalization and provide actionable recommendations.</p></details>|[2504.19572](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19572)|null|
|**2025-04-25**|**Certifiably-Correct Mapping for Safe Navigation Despite Odometry Drift**|<details><summary>Show Abstract</summary><p>Accurate perception, state estimation and mapping are essential for safe robotic navigation as planners and controllers rely on these components for safety-critical decisions. However, existing mapping approaches often assume perfect pose estimates, an unrealistic assumption that can lead to incorrect obstacle maps and therefore collisions. This paper introduces a framework for certifiably-correct mapping that ensures that the obstacle map correctly classifies obstacle-free regions despite the odometry drift in vision-based localization systems (VIO}/SLAM). By deflating the safe region based on the incremental odometry error at each timestep, we ensure that the map remains accurate and reliable locally around the robot, even as the overall odometry error with respect to the inertial frame grows unbounded.   Our contributions include two approaches to modify popular obstacle mapping paradigms, (I) Safe Flight Corridors, and (II) Signed Distance Fields. We formally prove the correctness of both methods, and describe how they integrate with existing planning and control modules. Simulations using the Replica dataset highlight the efficacy of our methods compared to state-of-the-art techniques. Real-world experiments with a robotic rover show that, while baseline methods result in collisions with previously mapped obstacles, the proposed framework enables the rover to safely stop before potential collisions.</p></details>|[2504.18713](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18713)|null|

Although HMDs provide joint signals from the head and hands, reconstructing a full-body pose remains challenging due to the unconstrained lower body. Recent advancements often rely on conventional neural networks and generative models to improve performance in this task, such as Transformers and diffusion models. However, these approaches struggle to strike a balance between achieving precise pose reconstruction and maintaining fast inference speed. To overcome these challenges, a lightweight and efficient model, SSD-Poser, is designed for robust full-body motion estimation from sparse observations. SSD-Poser incorporates a well-designed hybrid encoder, State Space Attention Encoders, to adapt the state space duality to complex motion poses and enable real-time realistic pose reconstruction. Moreover, a Frequency-Aware Decoder is introduced to mitigate jitter caused by variable-frequency motion signals, remarkably enhancing the motion smoothness. Comprehensive experiments on the AMASS dataset demonstrate that SSD-Poser achieves exceptional accuracy and computational efficiency, showing outstanding inference efficiency compared to state-of-the-art methods.</p></details>|[2504.18332](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18332)|null|

|**2025-04-24**|**A Guide to Structureless Visual Localization**|<details><summary>Show Abstract</summary><p>Visual localization algorithms, i.e., methods that estimate the camera pose of a query image in a known scene, are core components of many applications, including self-driving cars and augmented / mixed reality systems. State-of-the-art visual localization algorithms are structure-based, i.e., they store a 3D model of the scene and use 2D-3D correspondences between the query image and 3D points in the model for camera pose estimation. While such approaches are highly accurate, they are also rather inflexible when it comes to adjusting the underlying 3D model after changes in the scene. Structureless localization approaches represent the scene as a database of images with known poses and thus offer a much more flexible representation that can be easily updated by adding or removing images. Although there is a large amount of literature on structure-based approaches, there is significantly less work on structureless methods. Hence, this paper is dedicated to providing the, to the best of our knowledge, first comprehensive discussion and comparison of structureless methods. Extensive experiments show that approaches that use a higher degree of classical geometric reasoning generally achieve higher pose accuracy. In particular, approaches based on classical absolute or semi-generalized relative pose estimation outperform very recent methods based on pose regression by a wide margin. Compared with state-of-the-art structure-based approaches, the flexibility of structureless methods comes at the cost of (slightly) lower pose accuracy, indicating an interesting direction for future work.</p></details>|[2504.17636](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17636)|null|

Pose estimation methods using Neural Networks (NN) based on an RGBD camera are highly accurate, but their accuracy significantly decreases when the camera acquires few texture and shape features at a current view point. However, it is difficult for previous mathematical model-based methods to estimate effective NV which is because the simple shaped objects have few shape features. Therefore, we focus on the relationship between the pose estimation and NV estimation. When the pose estimation is more accurate, the NV estimation is more accurate. Therefore, we develop a new pose estimation NN that estimates NV simultaneously. Experimental results showed that our NV estimation realized a pose estimation success rate 77.3\%, which was 7.4pt higher than the mathematical model-based NV calculation did. Moreover, we verified that the robot using our method displayed 84.2\% of products.</p></details>|[2504.17424](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17424)|null|

Specifically, leveraging statistical theory, we develop an asymptotically unbiased and $\sqrt {n}$ -consistent PnP estimator that accounts for varying 3D triangulation uncertainties, ensuring that the relative pose estimate converges to the ground truth as the number of features increases. Next, on the stereo VO pipeline side, we propose a framework that continuously triangulates contemporary features for tracking new frames, effectively decoupling temporal dependencies between pose and 3D point errors. We integrate the Bias-Eli-W PnP estimator into the proposed stereo VO pipeline, creating a synergistic effect that enhances the suppression of pose estimation errors. We validate the performance of our method on the KITTI and Oxford RobotCar datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that our method: 1) achieves significant improvements in both relative pose error and absolute trajectory error in large-scale environments; 2) provides reliable localization under erratic and unpredictable robot motions. The successful implementation of the Bias-Eli-W PnP in stereo VO indicates the importance of information screening in robotic estimation tasks with high-uncertainty measurements, shedding light on diverse applications where PnP is a key ingredient.</p></details>|[2504.17410](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17410)|null|

In this study, we proposed a novel architecture named Transformer based Encoder Decoder Network (TED Net) designed for estimating human skeleton poses from WiFi Channel State Information (CSI). TED Net integrates convolutional encoders with transformer based attention mechanisms to capture spatiotemporal features from CSI signals. The estimated skeleton poses were used as input to a customized Directed Graph Neural Network (DGNN) for action recognition. We validated our model on two datasets: a publicly available multi modal dataset for assessing general pose estimation, and a newly collected dataset focused on fall related scenarios involving 20 participants. Experimental results demonstrated that TED Net outperformed existing approaches in pose estimation, and that the DGNN achieves reliable action classification using CSI based skeletons, with performance comparable to RGB based systems. Notably, TED Net maintains robust performance across both fall and non fall cases. These findings highlight the potential of CSI driven human skeleton estimation for effective action recognition, particularly in home environments such as elderly fall detection. In such settings, WiFi signals are often readily available, offering a privacy preserving alternative to vision based methods, which may raise concerns about continuous camera monitoring.</p></details>|[2504.16655](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16655)|null|

This study presents a deep learning-based model for detecting cattle lameness, sickness, or gait abnormalities using publicly available video data. The dataset consists of 50 unique videos from 40 individual cattle, recorded from various angles in both indoor and outdoor environments. Half of the dataset represents naturally walking (normal/non-lame) cattle, while the other half consists of cattle exhibiting gait abnormalities (lame). To enhance model robustness and generalizability, data augmentation was applied to the training data. The pre-processed videos were then classified using two deep learning models: ConvLSTM2D and 3D CNN. A comparative analysis of the results demonstrates strong classification performance. Specifically, the 3D CNN model achieved a video-level classification accuracy of 90%, with precision, recall, and f1-score of 90.9%, 90.9%, and 90.91% respectively. The ConvLSTM2D model exhibited a slightly lower accuracy of 85%. This study highlights the effectiveness of directly applying classification models to learn spatiotemporal features from video data, offering an alternative to traditional multi-stage approaches that typically involve object detection, pose estimation, and feature extraction. Besides, the findings demonstrate that the proposed deep learning models, particularly the 3D CNN, effectively classify and detect lameness in cattle while simplifying the processing pipeline.</p></details>|[2504.16404](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16404)|null|
|**2025-04-22**|**SignX: The Foundation Model for Sign Recognition**|<details><summary>Show Abstract</summary><p>The complexity of sign language data processing brings many challenges. The current approach to recognition of ASL signs aims to translate RGB sign language videos through pose information into English-based ID glosses, which serve to uniquely identify ASL signs. Note that there is no shared convention for assigning such glosses to ASL signs, so it is essential that the same glossing conventions are used for all of the data in the datasets that are employed. This paper proposes SignX, a foundation model framework for sign recognition. It is a concise yet powerful framework applicable to multiple human activity recognition scenarios. First, we developed a Pose2Gloss component based on an inverse diffusion model, which contains a multi-track pose fusion layer that unifies five of the most powerful pose information sources--SMPLer-X, DWPose, Mediapipe, PrimeDepth, and Sapiens Segmentation--into a single latent pose representation. Second, we trained a Video2Pose module based on ViT that can directly convert raw video into signer pose representation. Through this 2-stage training framework, we enable sign language recognition models to be compatible with existing pose formats, laying the foundation for the common pose estimation necessary for sign recognition. Experimental results show that SignX can recognize signs from sign language video, producing predicted gloss representations with greater accuracy than has been reported in prior work.</p></details>|[2504.16315](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16315)|null|

Although utilizing facial landmarks is valuable for this purpose, existing landmark-based methods prioritize precision over simplicity and model size, limiting their deployment on edge devices and in compute-poor environments. To bridge this gap, we propose \textbf{Grouped Attention Deep Sets (GADS)}, a novel architecture based on the Deep Set framework.

Planetary rovers are already equipped with GPR for geologic subsurface characterization. GPR has been successfully used to localize vehicles on Earth, but it has not yet been explored as another modality for localization on a planetary rover.

|**2025-04-21**|**Seeing from Another Perspective: Evaluating Multi-View Understanding in MLLMs**|<details><summary>Show Abstract</summary><p>Multi-view understanding, the ability to reconcile visual information across diverse viewpoints for effective navigation, manipulation, and 3D scene comprehension, is a fundamental challenge in Multi-Modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to be used as embodied agents. While recent MLLMs have shown impressive advances in high-level reasoning and planning, they frequently fall short when confronted with multi-view geometric consistency and cross-view correspondence. To comprehensively evaluate the challenges of MLLMs in multi-view scene reasoning, we propose All-Angles Bench, a benchmark of over 2,100 human carefully annotated multi-view question-answer pairs across 90 diverse real-world scenes. Our six tasks (counting, attribute identification, relative distance, relative direction, object manipulation, and camera pose estimation) specifically test model's geometric correspondence and the capacity to align information consistently across views. Our extensive experiments, benchmark on 27 representative MLLMs including Gemini-2.0-Flash, Claude-3.7-Sonnet, and GPT-4o against human evaluators reveals a substantial performance gap, indicating that current MLLMs remain far from human-level proficiency. Through in-depth analysis, we show that MLLMs are particularly underperforming under two aspects: (1) cross-view correspondence for partially occluded views and (2) establishing the coarse camera poses. These findings highlight the necessity of domain-specific refinements or modules that embed stronger multi-view awareness. We believe that our All-Angles Bench offers valuable insights and contribute to bridging the gap between MLLMs and human-level multi-view understanding. The project and benchmark are publicly available at https://danielchyeh.github.io/All-Angles-Bench/.</p></details>|[2504.15280](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15280)|**[link](https://github.com/Chenyu-Wang567/All-Angles-Bench)**|

While prior research combining visual and tactile (visuotactile) information has shown promise, these approaches often struggle with generalization due to the limited availability of visuotactile data. In this paper, we introduce ViTa-Zero, a zero-shot visuotactile pose estimation framework. Our key innovation lies in leveraging a visual model as its backbone and performing feasibility checking and test-time optimization based on physical constraints derived from tactile and proprioceptive observations. Specifically, we model the gripper-object interaction as a spring-mass system, where tactile sensors induce attractive forces, and proprioception generates repulsive forces. We validate our framework through experiments on a real-world robot setup, demonstrating its effectiveness across representative visual backbones and manipulation scenarios, including grasping, object picking, and bimanual handover. Compared to the visual models, our approach overcomes some drastic failure modes while tracking the in-hand object pose. In our experiments, our approach shows an average increase of 55% in AUC of ADD-S and 60% in ADD, along with an 80% lower position error compared to FoundationPose.</p></details>|[2504.13179](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13179)|null|

Recent neural rendering advances have enabled holistic human-scene reconstruction but require pre-calibrated camera and human poses, and days of training time. In this work, we introduce a novel unified framework that simultaneously performs camera tracking, human pose estimation and human-scene reconstruction in an online fashion. 3D Gaussian Splatting is utilized to learn Gaussian primitives for humans and scenes efficiently, and reconstruction-based camera tracking and human pose estimation modules are designed to enable holistic understanding and effective disentanglement of pose and appearance. Specifically, we design a human deformation module to reconstruct the details and enhance generalizability to out-of-distribution poses faithfully. Aiming to learn the spatial correlation between human and scene accurately, we introduce occlusion-aware human silhouette rendering and monocular geometric priors, which further improve reconstruction quality. Experiments on the EMDB and NeuMan datasets demonstrate superior or on-par performance with existing methods in camera tracking, human pose estimation, novel view synthesis and runtime.

Among these factors, camera viewpoints and locations {have been shown} to contribute significantly to the domain gap by influencing the global positions of human poses. To address this, we propose a novel framework that explicitly conducts global transformations between pose positions in the camera coordinate systems of source and target domains. We start with a Pseudo-Label Generation Module that is applied to the 2D poses of the target dataset to generate pseudo-3D poses. Then, a Global Transformation Module leverages a human-centered coordinate system as a novel bridging mechanism to seamlessly align the positional orientations of poses across disparate domains, ensuring consistent spatial referencing. To further enhance generalization, a Pose Augmentor is incorporated to address variations in human posture and body size. This process is iterative, allowing refined pseudo-labels to progressively improve guidance for domain adaptation. Our method is evaluated on various cross-dataset benchmarks, including Human3.6M, MPI-INF-3DHP, and 3DPW. The proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches and even outperforms the target-trained model.</p></details>|[2504.12699](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12699)|null|

However, as these techniques migrate towards lower-fidelity IMUs on ubiquitous commodity devices, like phones, watches, and earbuds, challenges arise including compromised online performance, temporal consistency, and loss of global translation due to sensor noise and drift. Addressing these challenges, we introduce MobilePoser, a real-time system for full-body pose and global translation estimation using any available subset of IMUs already present in these consumer devices. MobilePoser employs a multi-stage deep neural network for kinematic pose estimation followed by a physics-based motion optimizer, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy while remaining lightweight. We conclude with a series of demonstrative applications to illustrate the unique potential of MobilePoser across a variety of fields, such as health and wellness, gaming, and indoor navigation to name a few.</p></details>|[2504.12492](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12492)|null|
|**2025-04-16**|**Diffusion Based Robust LiDAR Place Recognition**|<details><summary>Show Abstract</summary><p>Mobile robots on construction sites require accurate pose estimation to perform autonomous surveying and inspection missions. Localization in construction sites is a particularly challenging problem due to the presence of repetitive features such as flat plastered walls and perceptual aliasing due to apartments with similar layouts inter and intra floors. In this paper, we focus on the global re-positioning of a robot with respect to an accurate scanned mesh of the building solely using LiDAR data. In our approach, a neural network is trained on synthetic LiDAR point clouds generated by simulating a LiDAR in an accurate real-life large-scale mesh. We train a diffusion model with a PointNet++ backbone, which allows us to model multiple position candidates from a single LiDAR point cloud. The resulting model can successfully predict the global position of LiDAR in confined and complex sites despite the adverse effects of perceptual aliasing. The learned distribution of potential global positions can provide multi-modal position distribution. We evaluate our approach across five real-world datasets and show the place recognition accuracy of 77% +/-2m on average while outperforming baselines at a factor of 2 in mean error.</p></details>|[2504.12412](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12412)|null|

While DUSt3R and its successors have achieved breakthroughs in 3D reconstruction from unposed images, these methods exhibit significant limitations when scaling to multi-view scenarios, including high computational cost and cumulative error induced by global alignment. To address these challenges, we propose Regist3R, a novel stereo foundation model tailored for efficient and scalable incremental reconstruction. Regist3R leverages an incremental reconstruction paradigm, enabling large-scale 3D reconstructions from unordered and many-view image collections. We evaluate Regist3R on public datasets for camera pose estimation and 3D reconstruction. Our experiments demonstrate that Regist3R achieves comparable performance with optimization-based methods while significantly improving computational efficiency, and outperforms existing multi-view reconstruction models. Furthermore, to assess its performance in real-world applications, we introduce a challenging oblique aerial dataset which has long spatial spans and hundreds of views. The results highlight the effectiveness of Regist3R. We also demonstrate the first attempt to reconstruct large-scale scenes encompassing over thousands of views through pointmap-based foundation models, showcasing its potential for practical applications in large-scale 3D reconstruction tasks, including urban modeling, aerial mapping, and beyond.</p></details>|[2504.12356](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12356)|null|

Rather than match detections across time, poses are updated directly from a new input image, which enables online tracking through occlusion.

Users have the possibility to access the entire Mixed Reality (MR) continuum. Goal of the human-computer-interaction (HCI) community is to allow natural and intuitive interactions but in general interactions for XR often rely on handheld controllers. One natural interaction method is full body tracking (FBT), where a user can use their body to interact with the experience. Classically, FBT systems require markers or trackers on the users to capture motion. Recently, there have been approaches based on Human Pose Estimation (HPE), which highlight the potential of low-cost non-intrusive FBT for XR. Due to the lack of handheld devices, HPE may also improve accessibility with people struggling with traditional input methods. This paper proposes the concept of non-intrusive FBT for XR for all. The goal is to spark a discussion on advantages for users by using a non-intrusive FBT system for accessibility and user experience.</p></details>|[2504.11987](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11987)|null|
|**2025-04-16**|**An Online Adaptation Method for Robust Depth Estimation and Visual Odometry in the Open World**|<details><summary>Show Abstract</summary><p>Recently, learning-based robotic navigation systems have gained extensive research attention and made significant progress. However, the diversity of open-world scenarios poses a major challenge for the generalization of such systems to practical scenarios. Specifically, learned systems for scene measurement and state estimation tend to degrade when the application scenarios deviate from the training data, resulting to unreliable depth and pose estimation. Toward addressing this problem, this work aims to develop a visual odometry system that can fast adapt to diverse novel environments in an online manner. To this end, we construct a self-supervised online adaptation framework for monocular visual odometry aided by an online-updated depth estimation module. Firstly, we design a monocular depth estimation network with lightweight refiner modules, which enables efficient online adaptation. Then, we construct an objective for self-supervised learning of the depth estimation module based on the output of the visual odometry system and the contextual semantic information of the scene. Specifically, a sparse depth densification module and a dynamic consistency enhancement module are proposed to leverage camera poses and contextual semantics to generate pseudo-depths and valid masks for the online adaptation. Finally, we demonstrate the robustness and generalization capability of the proposed method in comparison with state-of-the-art learning-based approaches on urban, in-house datasets and a robot platform.

|**2025-04-17**|**CAP-Net: A Unified Network for 6D Pose and Size Estimation of Categorical Articulated Parts from a Single RGB-D Image**|<details><summary>Show Abstract</summary><p>This paper tackles category-level pose estimation of articulated objects in robotic manipulation tasks and introduces a new benchmark dataset. While recent methods estimate part poses and sizes at the category level, they often rely on geometric cues and complex multi-stage pipelines that first segment parts from the point cloud, followed by Normalized Part Coordinate Space (NPCS) estimation for 6D poses. These approaches overlook dense semantic cues from RGB images, leading to suboptimal accuracy, particularly for objects with small parts. To address these limitations, we propose a single-stage Network, CAP-Net, for estimating the 6D poses and sizes of Categorical Articulated Parts. This method combines RGB-D features to generate instance segmentation and NPCS representations for each part in an end-to-end manner. CAP-Net uses a unified network to simultaneously predict point-wise class labels, centroid offsets, and NPCS maps. A clustering algorithm then groups points of the same predicted class based on their estimated centroid distances to isolate each part. Finally, the NPCS region of each part is aligned with the point cloud to recover its final pose and size. To bridge the sim-to-real domain gap, we introduce the RGBD-Art dataset, the largest RGB-D articulated dataset to date, featuring photorealistic RGB images and depth noise simulated from real sensors. Experimental evaluations on the RGBD-Art dataset demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art approach. Real-world deployments of our model in robotic tasks underscore its robustness and exceptional sim-to-real transfer capabilities, confirming its substantial practical utility. Our dataset, code and pre-trained models are available on the project page.</p></details>|[2504.11230](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11230)|null|

For this task, monocular category-level methods are attractive as they require only a single RGB camera. However, current methods rely on shape priors or CAD models of the intra-class known objects. We propose a diffusion-based monocular category-level 9D object pose generation method, MonoDiff9D. Our motivation is to leverage the probabilistic nature of diffusion models to alleviate the need for shape priors, CAD models, or depth sensors for intra-class unknown object pose estimation. We first estimate coarse depth via DINOv2 from the monocular image in a zero-shot manner and convert it into a point cloud. We then fuse the global features of the point cloud with the input image and use the fused features along with the encoded time step to condition MonoDiff9D. Finally, we design a transformer-based denoiser to recover the object pose from Gaussian noise. Extensive experiments on two popular benchmark datasets show that MonoDiff9D achieves state-of-the-art monocular category-level 9D object pose estimation accuracy without the need for shape priors or CAD models at any stage.

|**2025-04-15**|**Differentially Private 2D Human Pose Estimation**|<details><summary>Show Abstract</summary><p>Human pose estimation (HPE) has become essential in numerous applications including healthcare, activity recognition, and human-computer interaction. However, the privacy implications of processing sensitive visual data present significant deployment barriers in critical domains. While traditional anonymization techniques offer limited protection and often compromise data utility for broader motion analysis, Differential Privacy (DP) provides formal privacy guarantees but typically degrades model performance when applied naively. In this work, we present the first differentially private 2D human pose estimation (2D-HPE) by applying Differentially Private Stochastic Gradient Descent (DP-SGD) to this task. To effectively balance privacy with performance, we adopt Projected DP-SGD (PDP-SGD), which projects the noisy gradients to a low-dimensional subspace. Additionally, we adapt TinyViT, a compact and efficient vision transformer for coordinate classification in HPE, providing a lightweight yet powerful backbone that enhances privacy-preserving deployment feasibility on resource-limited devices. Our approach is particularly valuable for multimedia interpretation tasks, enabling privacy-safe analysis and understanding of human motion across diverse visual media while preserving the semantic meaning required for downstream applications. Comprehensive experiments on the MPII Human Pose Dataset demonstrate significant performance enhancement with PDP-SGD achieving 78.48% PCKh@0.5 at a strict privacy budget ( $\epsilon=0.2$ ), compared to 63.85% for standard DP-SGD. This work lays foundation for privacy-preserving human pose estimation in real-world, sensitive applications.</p></details>|[2504.10190](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10190)|null|

Advancements in neural networks have significantly alleviated this burden, enabling highly accurate ball tracking in sports broadcasts. However, relying solely on 2D ball tracking is limiting, as it depends on the camera's viewpoint and falls short of supporting comprehensive game analysis. To address this limitation, we propose a novel approach for reconstructing precise 3D ball trajectories from online table tennis match recordings. Our method leverages the underlying physics of the ball's motion to identify the bounce state that minimizes the reprojection error of the ball's flying trajectory, hence ensuring an accurate and reliable 3D reconstruction. A key advantage of our approach is its ability to infer ball spin without relying on human pose estimation or racket tracking, which are often unreliable or unavailable in broadcast footage. We developed an automated camera calibration method capable of reliably tracking camera movements. Additionally, we adapted an existing 3D pose estimation model, which lacks depth motion capture, to accurately track player movements. Together, these contributions enable the full 3D reconstruction of a table tennis rally.</p></details>|[2504.10035](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10035)|null|

While Human Mesh Recovery (HMR) models can estimate joint rotations, they often exhibit lower accuracy in joint localization compared to 3D Human Pose Estimation (HPE) models. Recent work addressed this limitation by combining a 3D HPE model with inverse kinematics (IK) to estimate both joint locations and rotations. However, IK is computationally expensive. To overcome this, we propose a novel 2D-to-3D uplifting model that directly estimates 3D human poses, including joint rotations, in a single forward pass. We investigate multiple rotation representations, loss functions, and training strategies - both with and without access to ground truth rotations. Our models achieve state-of-the-art accuracy in rotation estimation, are 150 times faster than the IK-based approach, and surpass HMR models in joint localization precision.</p></details>|[2504.09953](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09953)|null|

Conventional optical 3D sensors struggle to capture transparent objects, and machine learning methods are often hindered by their reliance on high-quality datasets. Leveraging NeRF's capability for continuous spatial opacity modeling, our proposed architecture integrates a NeRF-based approach for reconstructing the 3D information of transparent objects. Despite this, certain portions of the reconstructed 3D information may remain incomplete. To address these deficiencies, we introduce a shape-prior-driven completion mechanism, further refined by a geometric pose estimation method we have developed. This allows us to obtain a complete and reliable 3D information of transparent objects. Utilizing this refined data, we perform scene-level grasp prediction and deploy the results in real-world robotic systems. Experimental validation demonstrates the efficacy of our architecture, showcasing its capability to reliably capture 3D information of various transparent objects in cluttered scenes, and correspondingly, achieve high-quality, stables, and executable grasp predictions.</p></details>|[2504.09868](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09868)|null|

Traditional registration methods often rely on external fiducial markers to achieve high accuracy and real-time performance. However, these markers introduce cumbersome calibration procedures and can be challenging to deploy in clinical settings. While commercial solutions have attempted real-time markerless tracking using the native RGB cameras of AR devices, their accuracy remains questionable for medical guidance, primarily due to occlusions and significant outliers between the live sensor data and the preoperative target anatomy point cloud derived from MRI or CT scans. In this work, we present a markerless framework that relies only on the depth sensor of AR devices and consists of two modules: a registration module for high-precision, outlier-robust target anatomy localization, and a tracking module for real-time pose estimation. The registration module integrates depth sensor error correction, a human-in-the-loop region filtering technique, and a robust global alignment with curvature-aware feature sampling, followed by local ICP refinement, for markerless alignment of preoperative models with patient anatomy. The tracking module employs a fast and robust registration algorithm that uses the initial pose from the registration module to estimate the target pose in real-time. We comprehensively evaluated the performance of both modules through simulation and real-world measurements. The results indicate that our markerless system achieves superior performance for registration and comparable performance for tracking to industrial solutions. The two-module design makes our system a one-stop solution for surgical procedures where the target anatomy moves or stays static during surgery.</p></details>|[2504.09498](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09498)|null|

Most recent 6D object pose methods rely on refinement to get accurate results. However, most existing refinement methods either suffer from noises in establishing correspondences, or rely on retraining for novel objects. SCFlow2 is based on the SCFlow model designed for refinement with shape constraint, but formulates the additional depth as a regularization in the iteration via 3D scene flow for RGBD frames.

Typically, the initialization is taken from Structure-from-Motion (SfM) algorithms; however, SfM is time-consuming and restricts the application of 3DGS in real-world scenarios and large-scale scene reconstruction. We introduce a constrained optimization method for simultaneous camera pose estimation and 3D reconstruction that does not require SfM support. Core to our approach is decomposing a camera pose into a sequence of camera-to-(device-)center and (device-)center-to-world optimizations. To facilitate, we propose two optimization constraints conditioned to the sensitivity of each parameter group and restricts each parameter's search space. In addition, as we learn the scene geometry directly from the noisy point clouds, we propose geometric constraints to improve the reconstruction quality. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed method significantly outperforms the existing (multi-modal) 3DGS baseline and methods supplemented by COLMAP on both our collected dataset and two public benchmarks.</p></details>|[2504.09129](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09129)|null|

Despite recent advances, there is no comprehensive pipeline yet for bimanual class-agnostic interaction reconstruction from a monocular RGB video, where two hands and an unknown object are interacting with each other. Previous works tackled the limited hand-object interaction case, where object templates are pre-known or only one hand is involved in the interaction. The bimanual interaction reconstruction exhibits severe occlusions introduced by complex interactions between two hands and an object. To solve this, we first introduce BIGS (Bimanual Interaction 3D Gaussian Splatting), a method that reconstructs 3D Gaussians of hands and an unknown object from a monocular video. To robustly obtain object Gaussians avoiding severe occlusions, we leverage prior knowledge of pre-trained diffusion model with score distillation sampling (SDS) loss, to reconstruct unseen object parts. For hand Gaussians, we exploit the 3D priors of hand model (i.e., MANO) and share a single Gaussian for two hands to effectively accumulate hand 3D information, given limited views. To further consider the 3D alignment between hands and objects, we include the interacting-subjects optimization step during Gaussian optimization. Our method achieves the state-of-the-art accuracy on two challenging datasets, in terms of 3D hand pose estimation (MPJPE), 3D object reconstruction (CDh, CDo, F10), and rendering quality (PSNR, SSIM, LPIPS), respectively.</p></details>|[2504.09097](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09097)|null|

However, existing AR systems require expert supervision and do not account for differences in the mentor and mentee robot configurations. To enable novices to train outside the operating room while receiving expert-informed guidance, we present dV-STEAR: an open-source system that plays back task-aligned expert demonstrations without assuming identical setup joint positions between expert and novice. Pose estimation was rigorously quantified, showing a registration error of 3.86 (SD=2.01)mm. In a user study (N=24), dV-STEAR significantly improved novice performance on tasks from the Fundamentals of Laparoscopic Surgery. In a single-handed ring-over-wire task, dV-STEAR increased completion speed (p=0.03) and reduced collision time (p=0.01) compared to dry-lab training alone. During a pick-and-place task, it improved success rates (p=0.004). Across both tasks, participants using dV-STEAR exhibited significantly more balanced hand use and reported lower frustration levels. This work presents a novel educational tool implemented on the da Vinci Research Kit, demonstrates its effectiveness in teaching novices, and builds the foundation for further AR integration into robot-assisted surgery.</p></details>|[2504.06677](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06677)|null|

While existing approaches primarily aim to enhance the performance of estimated 2D poses, they often struggle when applied to ground-truth 2D pose data. We observe that achieving accurate 3D pose reconstruction from ground-truth 2D poses requires precise modeling of local pose structures, alongside the ability to extract robust global spatio-temporal features. To address these challenges, we propose a novel Hyper-GCN and Shuffle Mamba (HGMamba) block, which processes input data through two parallel streams: Hyper-GCN and Shuffle-Mamba. The Hyper-GCN stream models the human body structure as hypergraphs with varying levels of granularity to effectively capture local joint dependencies. Meanwhile, the Shuffle Mamba stream leverages a state space model to perform spatio-temporal scanning across all joints, enabling the establishment of global dependencies. By adaptively fusing these two representations, HGMamba achieves strong global feature modeling while excelling at local structure modeling. We stack multiple HGMamba blocks to create three variants of our model, allowing users to select the most suitable configuration based on the desired speed-accuracy trade-off. Extensive evaluations on the Human3.6M and MPI-INF-3DHP benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. HGMamba-B achieves state-of-the-art results, with P1 errors of 38.65 mm and 14.33 mm on the respective datasets.

Despite significant progress in pose estimation algorithms targeting adults, such developments for infants remain limited. Existing algorithms for infant pose estimation, despite achieving commendable performance, depend on fully supervised approaches that require large amounts of labeled data. These algorithms also struggle with poor generalizability under distribution shifts. To address these challenges, we introduce SHIFT: Leveraging SyntHetic Adult Datasets for Unsupervised InFanT Pose Estimation, which leverages the pseudo-labeling-based Mean-Teacher framework to compensate for the lack of labeled data and addresses distribution shifts by enforcing consistency between the student and the teacher pseudo-labels. Additionally, to penalize implausible predictions obtained from the mean-teacher framework, we incorporate an infant manifold pose prior. To enhance SHIFT's self-occlusion perception ability, we propose a novel visibility consistency module for improved alignment of the predicted poses with the original image. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks show that SHIFT significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) pose estimation methods by 5% and supervised infant pose estimation methods by a margin of 16%.

These factors generate difficulties in the accurate recognition of human intentions and the generation of comfortable, socially aware trajectories. To address these issues, we propose SAP-CoPE, a social-aware planning framework that integrates cooperative infrastructure with a novel 3D human pose estimation method and a model predictive control-based controller. This real-time framework formulates an optimization problem that accounts for uncertainty propagation in the camera projection matrix while ensuring human joint coherence. The proposed method is adaptable to single- or multi-camera configurations and can incorporate sparse LiDAR point-cloud data. To enhance safety and comfort in human environments, we integrate a human personal space field based on human pose into a model predictive controller, enabling the system to navigate while avoiding discomfort zones. Extensive evaluations in both simulated and real-world settings demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in generating socially aware trajectories for autonomous systems.</p></details>|[2504.05727](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05727)|**[link](https://github.com/HopeYless/SAP-CoPE-Project)**|
|**2025-04-08**|**POMATO: Marrying Pointmap Matching with Temporal Motion for Dynamic 3D Reconstruction**|<details><summary>Show Abstract</summary><p>3D reconstruction in dynamic scenes primarily relies on the combination of geometry estimation and matching modules where the latter task is pivotal for distinguishing dynamic regions which can help to mitigate the interference introduced by camera and object motion. Furthermore, the matching module explicitly models object motion, enabling the tracking of specific targets and advancing motion understanding in complex scenarios. Recently, the proposed representation of pointmap in DUSt3R suggests a potential solution to unify both geometry estimation and matching in 3D space, but it still struggles with ambiguous matching in dynamic regions, which may hamper further improvement. In this work, we present POMATO, a unified framework for dynamic 3D reconstruction by marrying pointmap matching with temporal motion. Specifically, our method first learns an explicit matching relationship by mapping RGB pixels from both dynamic and static regions across different views to 3D pointmaps within a unified coordinate system. Furthermore, we introduce a temporal motion module for dynamic motions that ensures scale consistency across different frames and enhances performance in tasks requiring both precise geometry and reliable matching, most notably 3D point tracking. We show the effectiveness of the proposed pointmap matching and temporal fusion paradigm by demonstrating the remarkable performance across multiple downstream tasks, including video depth estimation, 3D point tracking, and pose estimation.

Existing methods for extracting affine correspondences still have many limitations in terms of performance; thus, exploring a new paradigm is crucial. In this paper, we present a new pipeline designed for extracting accurate affine correspondences by integrating dense matching and geometric constraints. Specifically, a novel extraction framework is introduced, with the aid of dense matching and a novel keypoint scale and orientation estimator. For this purpose, we propose loss functions based on geometric constraints, which can effectively improve accuracy by supervising neural networks to learn feature geometry. The experimental show that the accuracy and robustness of our method outperform the existing ones in image matching tasks. To further demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, we applied it to relative pose estimation. Affine correspondences extracted by our method lead to more accurate poses than the baselines on a range of real-world datasets.

It is well studied for optical cameras, but research is lacking for 2D forward-looking sonar (FLS) in underwater scenarios due to the vastly different imaging principles. In this paper, we demonstrate that, despite the nonlinearity inherent in sonar image formation, the P$n$ P problem for 2D FLS can still be effectively addressed within a point-to-line (PtL) 3D registration paradigm through orthographic approximation. The registration is then resolved by a duality-based optimal solver, ensuring the global optimality. For coplanar cases, a null space analysis is conducted to retrieve the solutions from the dual formulation, enabling the methods to be applied to more general cases. Extensive simulations have been conducted to systematically evaluate the performance under different settings. Compared to non-reprojection-optimized state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods, the proposed approach achieves significantly higher precision. When both methods are optimized, ours demonstrates comparable or slightly superior precision.</p></details>|[2504.04445](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04445)|null|

Although recent SfM pipelines have made impressive progress, questions remain about how to further improve both their robust performance in challenging conditions (e.g., textureless scenes) and the precision of camera parameter estimation simultaneously. We present 3R-GS, a 3D Gaussian Splatting framework that bridges this gap by jointly optimizing 3D Gaussians and camera parameters from large reconstruction priors MASt3R-SfM. We note that naively performing joint 3D Gaussian and camera optimization faces two challenges: the sensitivity to the quality of SfM initialization, and its limited capacity for global optimization, leading to suboptimal reconstruction results. Our 3R-GS, overcomes these issues by incorporating optimized practices, enabling robust scene reconstruction even with imperfect camera registration. Extensive experiments demonstrate that 3R-GS delivers high-quality novel view synthesis and precise camera pose estimation while remaining computationally efficient.

In 2024, our goal was to transition BOP from lab-like setups to real-world scenarios. First, we introduced new model-free tasks, where no 3D object models are available and methods need to onboard objects just from provided reference videos. Second, we defined a new, more practical 6D object detection task where identities of objects visible in a test image are not provided as input. Third, we introduced new BOP-H3 datasets recorded with high-resolution sensors and AR/VR headsets, closely resembling real-world scenarios. BOP-H3 include 3D models and onboarding videos to support both model-based and model-free tasks. Participants competed on seven challenge tracks, each defined by a task, object onboarding setup, and dataset group. Notably, the best 2024 method for model-based 6D localization of unseen objects (FreeZeV2.1) achieves 22% higher accuracy on BOP-Classic-Core than the best 2023 method (GenFlow), and is only 4% behind the best 2023 method for seen objects (GPose2023) although being significantly slower (24.9 vs 2.7s per image). A more practical 2024 method for this task is Co-op which takes only 0.8s per image and is 25X faster and 13% more accurate than GenFlow. Methods have a similar ranking on 6D detection as on 6D localization but higher run time. On model-based 2D detection of unseen objects, the best 2024 method (MUSE) achieves 21% relative improvement compared to the best 2023 method (CNOS). However, the 2D detection accuracy for unseen objects is still noticealy (-53%) behind the accuracy for seen objects (GDet2023).

In this paper, we introduce PicoPose, a novel framework designed to tackle this task using a three-stage pixel-to-pixel correspondence learning process. Firstly, PicoPose matches features from the RGB observation with those from rendered object templates, identifying the best-matched template and establishing coarse correspondences. Secondly, PicoPose smooths the correspondences by globally regressing a 2D affine transformation, including in-plane rotation, scale, and 2D translation, from the coarse correspondence map. Thirdly, PicoPose applies the affine transformation to the feature map of the best-matched template and learns correspondence offsets within local regions to achieve fine-grained correspondences. By progressively refining the correspondences, PicoPose significantly improves the accuracy of object poses computed via PnP/RANSAC. PicoPose achieves state-of-the-art performance on the seven core datasets of the BOP benchmark, demonstrating exceptional generalization to novel objects represented by CAD models or object reference images.

Monocular 3D human pose estimation is challenged by depth ambiguity, limited 3D-labeled training data, imbalanced modeling, and restricted model generalization. To address these limitations, our work introduces a groundbreaking motion pre-training method based on contextualized representation learning. Specifically, our method involves masking 2D pose features and utilizing a Transformer-GCN dual-stream model to learn high-dimensional representations through a self-distillation setup. By focusing on contextualized representation learning and spatial-temporal modeling, our approach enhances the model's ability to understand spatial-temporal relationships between postures, resulting in superior generalization. Furthermore, leveraging the Transformer-GCN dual-stream model, our approach effectively balances global and local interactions in video pose estimation. The model adaptively integrates information from both the Transformer and GCN streams, where the GCN stream effectively learns local relationships between adjacent key points and frames, while the Transformer stream captures comprehensive global spatial and temporal features. Our model achieves state-of-the-art performance on two benchmark datasets, with an MPJPE of 38.0mm and P-MPJPE of 31.9mm on Human3.6M, and an MPJPE of 15.9mm on MPI-INF-3DHP.

|**2025-04-02**|**ForestVO: Enhancing Visual Odometry in Forest Environments through ForestGlue**|<details><summary>Show Abstract</summary><p>Recent advancements in visual odometry systems have improved autonomous navigation; however, challenges persist in complex environments like forests, where dense foliage, variable lighting, and repetitive textures compromise feature correspondence accuracy. To address these challenges, we introduce ForestGlue, enhancing the SuperPoint feature detector through four configurations - grayscale, RGB, RGB-D, and stereo-vision - optimised for various sensing modalities. For feature matching, we employ LightGlue or SuperGlue, retrained with synthetic forest data. ForestGlue achieves comparable pose estimation accuracy to baseline models but requires only 512 keypoints - just 25% of the baseline's 2048 - to reach an LO-RANSAC AUC score of 0.745 at a 10{\deg} threshold. With only a quarter of keypoints needed, ForestGlue significantly reduces computational overhead, demonstrating effectiveness in dynamic forest environments, and making it suitable for real-time deployment on resource-constrained platforms. By combining ForestGlue with a transformer-based pose estimation model, we propose ForestVO, which estimates relative camera poses using matched 2D pixel coordinates between frames. On challenging TartanAir forest sequences, ForestVO achieves an average relative pose error (RPE) of 1.09 m and a kitti_score of 2.33%, outperforming direct-based methods like DSO by 40% in dynamic scenes. Despite using only 10% of the dataset for training, ForestVO maintains competitive performance with TartanVO while being a significantly lighter model. This work establishes an end-to-end deep learning pipeline specifically tailored for visual odometry in forested environments, leveraging forest-specific training data to optimise feature correspondence and pose estimation, thereby enhancing the accuracy and robustness of autonomous navigation systems.</p></details>|[2504.01261](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01261)|**[link](https://github.com/aerialroboticsgroup/forest-vo)**|

Despite notable progress in some existing approaches, our study reveals that the scarcity of high-quality datasets remains a significant bottleneck, limiting the full potential of current methods. To address this challenge, we propose a novel Controllable Image Generation Pipeline for synthesizing animal pose estimation data, termed AP-CAP.

In contrast, the limited scale and diversity of available 4D datasets present a major bottleneck for training a highly generalizable 4D model. This constraint has driven conventional 4D methods to fine-tune 3D models on scalable dynamic video data with additional geometric priors such as optical flow and depths. In this work, we take an opposite path and introduce Easi3R, a simple yet efficient training-free method for 4D reconstruction. Our approach applies attention adaptation during inference, eliminating the need for from-scratch pre-training or network fine-tuning. We find that the attention layers in DUSt3R inherently encode rich information about camera and object motion. By carefully disentangling these attention maps, we achieve accurate dynamic region segmentation, camera pose estimation, and 4D dense point map reconstruction.

We extract keypoints from the reference image and generate a 3D reference map with 3D reconstruction of the keypoints in advance. We emphasize that the more keypoints in the 3D reference map and the smaller the error of the 3D positions of the keypoints, the higher the accuracy of the camera pose estimation. However, previous image-only methods require a huge number of images, and it is difficult to 3D-reconstruct keypoints without error due to inevitable mismatches and failures in feature matching. As a result, the 3D reference map is sparse and inaccurate. In contrast, accurate 3D reference maps can be generated by combining images and 3D sensors. Recently, 3D-LiDAR has been widely used around the world. LiDAR, which measures a large space with high density, has become inexpensive. In addition, accurately calibrated cameras are also widely used, so images that record the external parameters of the camera without errors can be easily obtained. In this paper, we propose a method to directly assign 3D LiDAR point clouds to keypoints to generate dense and accurate 3D reference maps. The proposed method avoids feature matching and achieves accurate 3D reconstruction for almost all keypoints. To estimate camera pose over a wide area, we use the wide-area LiDAR point cloud to remove points that are not visible to the camera and reduce 2D-3D correspondence errors. Using indoor and outdoor datasets, we apply the proposed method to several state-of-the-art local features and confirm that it improves the accuracy of camera pose estimation.</p></details>|[2503.23664](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23664)|null|

In indoor environments, traditional Monte Carlo localization based on occupancy grid maps is considered the gold standard, but its accuracy is limited by the representation capabilities of the occupancy grid map. In this paper, we address the problem of building an effective map representation that allows to accurately perform probabilistic global localization. To this end, we propose an implicit neural map representation that is able to capture positional and directional geometric features from 2D LiDAR scans to efficiently represent the environment and learn a neural network that is able to predict both, the non-projective signed distance and a direction-aware projective distance for an arbitrary point in the mapped environment. This combination of neural map representation with a light-weight neural network allows us to design an efficient observation model within a conventional Monte Carlo localization framework for pose estimation of a robot in real time. We evaluated our approach to indoor localization on a publicly available dataset for global localization and the experimental results indicate that our approach is able to more accurately localize a mobile robot than other localization approaches employing occupancy or existing neural map representations. In contrast to other approaches employing an implicit neural map representation for 2D LiDAR localization, our approach allows to perform real-time pose tracking after convergence and near real-time global localization.

Modern global localization techniques often depend on dense LiDAR maps, which, while precise, require extensive storage and computational resources. Recent approaches have explored alternative methods, such as sparse maps and learned features, but they suffer from poor robustness and generalization. We propose SparseLoc, a global localization framework that leverages vision-language foundation models to generate sparse, semantic-topometric maps in a zero-shot manner. It combines this map representation with a Monte Carlo localization scheme enhanced by a novel late optimization strategy, ensuring improved pose estimation. By constructing compact yet highly discriminative maps and refining localization through a carefully designed optimization schedule, SparseLoc overcomes the limitations of existing techniques, offering a more efficient and robust solution for global localization. Our system achieves over a 5X improvement in localization accuracy compared to existing sparse mapping techniques. Despite utilizing only 1/500th of the points of dense mapping methods, it achieves comparable performance, maintaining an average global localization error below 5m and 2 degrees on KITTI sequences.</p></details>|[2503.23465](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23465)|null|

However, it remains challenging, particularly for the joint camera pose estimation. Previous approaches have achieved impressive pose-free surface reconstruction results in dense-view settings, but could easily fail for sparse-view scenarios without sufficient visual overlap. In this paper, we propose a new technique for pose-free surface reconstruction, which follows triplane-based signed distance field (SDF) learning but regularizes the learning by explicit points sampled from ray-based diffusion of camera pose estimation. Our key contribution is a novel Geometric Consistent Ray Diffusion model (GCRayDiffusion), where we represent camera poses as neural bundle rays and regress the distribution of noisy rays via a diffusion model. More importantly, we further condition the denoising process of RGRayDiffusion using the triplane-based SDF of the entire scene, which provides effective 3D consistent regularization to achieve multi-view consistent camera pose estimation. Finally, we incorporate RGRayDiffusion into the triplane-based SDF learning by introducing on-surface geometric regularization from the sampling points of the neural bundle rays, which leads to highly accurate pose-free surface reconstruction results even for sparse-view inputs. Extensive evaluations on public datasets show that our GCRayDiffusion achieves more accurate camera pose estimation than previous approaches, with geometrically more consistent surface reconstruction results, especially given sparse-view inputs.</p></details>|[2503.22349](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22349)|null|
|**2025-03-27**|**NeRF-based Point Cloud Reconstruction using a Stationary Camera for Agricultural Applications**|<details><summary>Show Abstract</summary><p>This paper presents a NeRF-based framework for point cloud (PCD) reconstruction, specifically designed for indoor high-throughput plant phenotyping facilities. Traditional NeRF-based reconstruction methods require cameras to move around stationary objects, but this approach is impractical for high-throughput environments where objects are rapidly imaged while moving on conveyors or rotating pedestals. To address this limitation, we develop a variant of NeRF-based PCD reconstruction that uses a single stationary camera to capture images as the object rotates on a pedestal. Our workflow comprises COLMAP-based pose estimation, a straightforward pose transformation to simulate camera movement, and subsequent standard NeRF training. A defined Region of Interest (ROI) excludes irrelevant scene data, enabling the generation of high-resolution point clouds (10M points). Experimental results demonstrate excellent reconstruction fidelity, with precision-recall analyses yielding an F-score close to 100.00 across all evaluated plant objects. Although pose estimation remains computationally intensive with a stationary camera setup, overall training and reconstruction times are competitive, validating the method's feasibility for practical high-throughput indoor phenotyping applications. Our findings indicate that high-quality NeRF-based 3D reconstructions are achievable using a stationary camera, eliminating the need for complex camera motion or costly imaging equipment. This approach is especially beneficial when employing expensive and delicate instruments, such as hyperspectral cameras, for 3D plant phenotyping. Future work will focus on optimizing pose estimation techniques and further streamlining the methodology to facilitate seamless integration into automated, high-throughput 3D phenotyping pipelines.</p></details>|[2503.21958](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21958)|null|

To achieve this, we train a transformer that takes an image as input and estimates the parameters of the model. Due to the lack of training data for this task, we build a pipeline to produce pseudo ground truth model parameters for single images and implement a training procedure that iteratively refines these pseudo labels. Compared to state-of-the-art methods for 3D human mesh recovery, our model achieves competitive performance on standard benchmarks, while it significantly outperforms them in settings with extreme 3D poses and viewpoints. Additionally, we show that previous reconstruction methods frequently violate joint angle limits, leading to unnatural rotations. In contrast, our approach leverages the biomechanically plausible degrees of freedom making more realistic joint rotation estimates. We validate our approach across multiple human pose estimation benchmarks. We make the code, models and data available at: https://isshikihugh.github.io/HSMR/</p></details>|[2503.21751](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21751)|**[link](https://isshikihugh.github.io/HSMR/)**|
|**2025-03-27**|**OccRobNet : Occlusion Robust Network for Accurate 3D Interacting Hand-Object Pose Estimation**|<details><summary>Show Abstract</summary><p>Occlusion is one of the challenging issues when estimating 3D hand pose. This problem becomes more prominent when hand interacts with an object or two hands are involved. In the past works, much attention has not been given to these occluded regions. But these regions contain important and beneficial information that is vital for 3D hand pose estimation. Thus, in this paper, we propose an occlusion robust and accurate method for the estimation of 3D hand-object pose from the input RGB image. Our method includes first localising the hand joints using a CNN based model and then refining them by extracting contextual information. The self attention transformer then identifies the specific joints along with the hand identity. This helps the model to identify the hand belongingness of a particular joint which helps to detect the joint even in the occluded region. Further, these joints with hand identity are then used to estimate the pose using cross attention mechanism. Thus, by identifying the joints in the occluded region, the obtained network becomes robust to occlusion. Hence, this network achieves state-of-the-art results when evaluated on the InterHand2.6M, HO3D and H $_2$ O3D datasets.</p></details>|[2503.21723](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21723)|null|

Current SLAM approaches predominantly rely on geometric cues for mapping and localization, but they often fail to ensure semantic consistency, particularly in dynamic or densely populated scenes. To address this limitation, we introduce STAMICS, a novel method that integrates semantic information with 3D Gaussian representations to enhance both localization and mapping accuracy. STAMICS consists of three key components: a 3D Gaussian-based scene representation for high-fidelity reconstruction, a graph-based clustering technique that enforces temporal semantic consistency, and an open-vocabulary system that allows for the classification of unseen objects. Extensive experiments show that STAMICS significantly improves camera pose estimation and map quality, outperforming state-of-the-art methods while reducing reconstruction errors.

Many existing approaches to the problem use a scan-to-map registration, which neglects the accumulation of errors within the maintained map due to drift. Other methods use a refinement step that jointly optimizes the local map on a feature basis. We propose a solution that avoids this by using multiple independent scan-to-scan Iterative Closest Points (ICP) registrations to previous scans in order to derive constraints for a pose graph. The optimization of the pose graph then not only yields an accurate estimate for the latest pose, but also enables the refinement of previous scans in the optimization window. By avoiding the need to recompute the scan-to-scan alignments, the computational load is minimized. Extensive evaluation on the public KITTI and MulRan datasets as well as on a custom automotive lidar dataset is carried out. Results show that the proposed approach achieves state-of-the-art estimation accuracy, while alleviating the mentioned issues.</p></details>|[2503.21293](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21293)|null|
|**2025-03-27**|**Recurrent Feature Mining and Keypoint Mixup Padding for Category-Agnostic Pose Estimation**|<details><summary>Show Abstract</summary><p>Category-agnostic pose estimation aims to locate keypoints on query images according to a few annotated support images for arbitrary novel classes. Existing methods generally extract support features via heatmap pooling, and obtain interacted features from support and query via cross-attention. Hence, these works neglect to mine fine-grained and structure-aware (FGSA) features from both support and query images, which are crucial for pixel-level keypoint localization. To this end, we propose a novel yet concise framework, which recurrently mines FGSA features from both support and query images. Specifically, we design a FGSA mining module based on deformable attention mechanism. On the one hand, we mine fine-grained features by applying deformable attention head over multi-scale feature maps. On the other hand, we mine structure-aware features by offsetting the reference points of keypoints to their linked keypoints. By means of above module, we recurrently mine FGSA features from support and query images, and thus obtain better support features and query estimations. In addition, we propose to use mixup keypoints to pad various classes to a unified keypoint number, which could provide richer supervision than the zero padding used in existing works. We conduct extensive experiments and in-depth studies on large-scale MP-100 dataset, and outperform SOTA method dramatically (+3.2\%PCK@0.05).

Recent works explored neural mesh models that approach a range of 2D and 3D tasks from an analysis-by-synthesis perspective. Despite the largely enhanced robustness to partial occlusion and domain shifts, these methods depended heavily on 3D annotations for part-contrastive learning, which confines them to a narrow set of categories and hinders efficient scaling. In this work, we present DINeMo, a novel neural mesh model that is trained with no 3D annotations by leveraging pseudo-correspondence obtained from large visual foundation models. We adopt a bidirectional pseudo-correspondence generation method, which produce pseudo correspondence utilize both local appearance features and global context information. Experimental results on car datasets demonstrate that our DINeMo outperforms previous zero- and few-shot 3D pose estimation by a wide margin, narrowing the gap with fully-supervised methods by 67.3%. Our DINeMo also scales effectively and efficiently when incorporating more unlabeled images during training, which demonstrate the advantages over supervised learning methods that rely on 3D annotations.

However, acquiring 3D HOI data is challenging due to its complexity and high cost, limiting existing methods to the narrow diversity of object types and interaction patterns in training datasets. This paper proposes a novel zero-shot HOI synthesis framework without relying on end-to-end training on currently limited 3D HOI datasets. The core idea of our method lies in leveraging extensive HOI knowledge from pre-trained Multimodal Models. Given a text description, our system first obtains temporally consistent 2D HOI image sequences using image or video generation models, which are then uplifted to 3D HOI milestones of human and object poses. We employ pre-trained human pose estimation models to extract human poses and introduce a generalizable category-level 6-DoF estimation method to obtain the object poses from 2D HOI images. Our estimation method is adaptive to various object templates obtained from text-to-3D models or online retrieval. A physics-based tracking of the 3D HOI kinematic milestone is further applied to refine both body motions and object poses, yielding more physically plausible HOI generation results. The experimental results demonstrate that our method is capable of generating open-vocabulary HOIs with physical realism and semantic diversity.</p></details>|[2503.20118](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20118)|null|

Here, we propose that combining visual information and proprioception with binary, low-resolution tactile contact measurements from across the interior surface of an articulated robotic hand can mitigate this issue. The visuo-tactile object-pose-estimation problem is formulated probabilistically in a factor graph. The pose of the object is optimized to align with the three kinds of measurements using a robust cost function to reduce the influence of visual or tactile outlier readings. The advantages of the proposed approach are first demonstrated in simulation: a custom 15-DoF robot hand with one binary tactile sensor per link grasps 17 YCB objects while observed by an RGB-D camera. This low-resolution in-hand tactile sensing significantly improves object-pose estimates under high occlusion and also high visual noise. We also show these benefits through grasping tests with a preliminary real version of our tactile hand, obtaining reasonable visuo-tactile estimates of object pose at approximately 13.3 Hz on average.</p></details>|[2503.19893](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19893)|null|

|**2025-03-24**|**Structure-Aware Correspondence Learning for Relative Pose Estimation**|<details><summary>Show Abstract</summary><p>Relative pose estimation provides a promising way for achieving object-agnostic pose estimation. Despite the success of existing 3D correspondence-based methods, the reliance on explicit feature matching suffers from small overlaps in visible regions and unreliable feature estimation for invisible regions. Inspired by humans' ability to assemble two object parts that have small or no overlapping regions by considering object structure, we propose a novel Structure-Aware Correspondence Learning method for Relative Pose Estimation, which consists of two key modules. First, a structure-aware keypoint extraction module is designed to locate a set of kepoints that can represent the structure of objects with different shapes and appearance, under the guidance of a keypoint based image reconstruction loss. Second, a structure-aware correspondence estimation module is designed to model the intra-image and inter-image relationships between keypoints to extract structure-aware features for correspondence estimation. By jointly leveraging these two modules, the proposed method can naturally estimate 3D-3D correspondences for unseen objects without explicit feature matching for precise relative pose estimation. Experimental results on the CO3D, Objaverse and LineMOD datasets demonstrate that the proposed method significantly outperforms prior methods, i.e., with 5.7{\deg}reduction in mean angular error on the CO3D dataset.</p></details>|[2503.18671](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18671)|null|

However, existing datasets and methodologies primarily target mainstream team sports such as soccer and conventional 5-on-5 basketball, often overlooking scenarios involving fixed-camera setups commonly used at amateur levels, less mainstream sports, or datasets that explicitly incorporate pose annotations. In this paper, we propose the TrackID3x3 dataset, the first publicly available comprehensive dataset specifically designed for multi-player tracking, player identification, and pose estimation in 3x3 basketball scenarios. The dataset comprises three distinct subsets (Indoor fixed-camera, Outdoor fixed-camera, and Drone camera footage), capturing diverse full-court camera perspectives and environments. We also introduce the Track-ID task, a simplified variant of the game state reconstruction task that excludes field detection and focuses exclusively on fixed-camera scenarios. To evaluate performance, we propose a baseline algorithm called Track-ID algorithm, tailored to assess tracking and identification quality. Furthermore, our benchmark experiments, utilizing recent multi-object tracking algorithms (e.g., BoT-SORT-ReID) and top-down pose estimation methods (HRNet, RTMPose, and SwinPose), demonstrate robust results and highlight remaining challenges. Our dataset and evaluation benchmarks provide a solid foundation for advancing automated analytics in 3x3 basketball.

Previous methods either treat the information equally or require the explicit storage of the entire context, tending to be laborious in real-world scenarios. Inspired by Mamba's inherent selectivity, we propose \textbf{CorrMamba}, a \textbf{Corr}espondence filter leveraging \textbf{Mamba}'s ability to selectively mine information from true correspondences while mitigating interference from false ones, thus achieving adaptive focus at a lower cost. To prevent Mamba from being potentially impacted by unordered keypoints that obscured its ability to mine spatial information, we customize a causal sequential learning approach based on the Gumbel-Softmax technique to establish causal dependencies between features in a fully autonomous and differentiable manner. Additionally, a local-context enhancement module is designed to capture critical contextual cues essential for correspondence pruning, complementing the core framework. Extensive experiments on relative pose estimation, visual localization, and analysis demonstrate that CorrMamba achieves state-of-the-art performance. Notably, in outdoor relative pose estimation, our method surpasses the previous SOTA by $2.58$ absolute percentage points in AUC@20\textdegree, highlighting its practical superiority.

Our method requires only the CAD model of the target object and can precisely estimate its pose without any additional fine-tuning. While existing model-based methods suffer from inefficiency due to using a large number of templates, our method enables fast and accurate estimation with a small number of templates. This improvement is achieved by finding semi-dense correspondences between the input image and the pre-rendered templates. Our method achieves strong generalization performance by leveraging a hybrid representation that combines patch-level classification and offset regression. Additionally, our pose refinement model estimates probabilistic flow between the input image and the rendered image, refining the initial estimate to an accurate pose using a differentiable PnP layer. We demonstrate that our method not only estimates object poses rapidly but also outperforms existing methods by a large margin on the seven core datasets of the BOP Challenge, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy.</p></details>|[2503.17731](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17731)|null|

In this work, we propose a novel framework that leverages motion blur as a rich cue for motion estimation rather than treating it as an unwanted artifact. Our approach works by predicting a dense motion flow field and a monocular depth map directly from a single motion-blurred image. We then recover the instantaneous camera velocity by solving a linear least squares problem under the small motion assumption. In essence, our method produces an IMU-like measurement that robustly captures fast and aggressive camera movements. To train our model, we construct a large-scale dataset with realistic synthetic motion blur derived from ScanNet++v2 and further refine our model by training end-to-end on real data using our fully differentiable pipeline. Extensive evaluations on real-world benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art angular and translational velocity estimates, outperforming current methods like MASt3R and COLMAP.</p></details>|[2503.17358](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17358)|null|

Building upon the recent DUSt3R paradigm, a transformer-based architecture that leverages powerful pre-training, our lightweight and versatile conditioning acts as additional guidance for the network to predict more accurate estimates when auxiliary information is available. During training we feed the model with random subsets of modalities at each iteration, which enables the model to operate under different levels of known priors at test time. This in turn opens up new capabilities, such as performing inference in native image resolution, or point-cloud completion.

This paper challenges the problem by efficient prompt learning for Vision-Language Pretrained (VLP) models, \textit{e.g.} CLIP, aiming to resolve the cross-species generalization problem. At the core of the solution lies in the prompt designing, probabilistic prompt modeling and cross-modal adaptation, thereby enabling prompts to compensate for cross-modal information and effectively overcome large data variances under unbalanced data distribution. To this end, we propose a novel probabilistic prompting approach to fully explore textual descriptions, which could alleviate the diversity issues caused by long-tail property and increase the adaptability of prompts on unseen category instance. Specifically, we first introduce a set of learnable prompts and propose a diversity loss to maintain distinctiveness among prompts, thus representing diverse image attributes. Diverse textual probabilistic representations are sampled and used as the guidance for the pose estimation. Subsequently, we explore three different cross-modal fusion strategies at spatial level to alleviate the adverse impacts of visual uncertainty.

Despite an already mature research endeavour for photos, there is no research on the efficient inference specifically designed for sketch data. In this paper, we first demonstrate existing state-of-the-art efficient light-weight models designed for photos do not work on sketches. We then propose two sketch-specific components which work in a plug-n-play manner on any photo efficient network to adapt them to work on sketch data. We specifically chose fine-grained sketch-based image retrieval (FG-SBIR) as a demonstrator as the most recognised sketch problem with immediate commercial value. Technically speaking, we first propose a cross-modal knowledge distillation network to transfer existing photo efficient networks to be compatible with sketch, which brings down number of FLOPs and model parameters by 97.96% percent and 84.89% respectively. We then exploit the abstract trait of sketch to introduce a RL-based canvas selector that dynamically adjusts to the abstraction level which further cuts down number of FLOPs by two thirds. The end result is an overall reduction of 99.37% of FLOPs (from 40.18G to 0.254G) when compared with a full network, while retaining the accuracy (33.03% vs 32.77%) -- finally making an efficient network for the sparse sketch data that exhibit even fewer FLOPs than the best photo counterpart.</p></details>|[2505.23763](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23763)|null|

Our approach captures 4D scenes from an online stream of color images with depth measurements or predictions by jointly optimizing scene geometry, appearance, dynamics, and camera ego-motion. Although natural environments exhibit complex non-rigid motions, 4D-SLAM remains relatively underexplored due to its inherent challenges; even with 2.5D signals, the problem is ill-posed because of the high dimensionality of the optimization space. To overcome these challenges, we first introduce a SLAM method based on Gaussian surface primitives that leverages depth signals more effectively than 3D Gaussians, thereby achieving accurate surface reconstruction. To further model non-rigid deformations, we employ a warp-field represented by a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) and introduce a novel camera pose estimation technique along with surface regularization terms that facilitate spatio-temporal reconstruction. In addition to these algorithmic challenges, a significant hurdle in 4D SLAM research is the lack of reliable ground truth and evaluation protocols, primarily due to the difficulty of 4D capture using commodity sensors. To address this, we present a novel open synthetic dataset of everyday objects with diverse motions, leveraging large-scale object models and animation modeling. In summary, we open up the modern 4D-SLAM research by introducing a novel method and evaluation protocols grounded in modern vision and rendering techniques.</p></details>|[2505.22859](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22859)|null|

First, the UAVPairs dataset, comprising 21,622 high-resolution images across 30 diverse scenes, is constructed; the 3D points and tracks generated by SfM-based 3D reconstruction are employed to define the geometric similarity of image pairs, ensuring genuinely matchable image pairs are used for training. Second, to solve the problem of expensive mining cost for global hard negative mining, a batched nontrivial sample mining strategy is proposed, leveraging the geometric similarity and multi-scene structure of the UAVPairs to generate training samples as to accelerate training. Third, recognizing the limitation of pair-based losses, the ranked list loss is designed to improve the discrimination of image retrieval models, which optimizes the global similarity structure constructed from the positive set and negative set. Finally, the effectiveness of the UAVPairs dataset and training pipeline is validated through comprehensive experiments on three distinct large-scale UAV datasets. The experiment results demonstrate that models trained with the UAVPairs dataset and the ranked list loss achieve significantly improved retrieval accuracy compared to models trained on existing datasets or with conventional losses. Furthermore, these improvements translate to enhanced view graph connectivity and higher quality of reconstructed 3D models. The models trained by the proposed approach perform more robustly compared with hand-crafted global features, particularly in challenging repetitively textured scenes and weakly textured scenes. For match pair retrieval of large-scale UAV images, the trained image retrieval models offer an effective solution.

The core idea is to divide the whole dataset into blocks based on the matrix band reduction (MBR) and achieve efficient feature matching via GPU-accelerated cascade hashing. First, match pairs are selected by using an image retrieval technique, which converts images into global descriptors and searches high-dimension nearest neighbors with graph indexing. Second, compact image blocks are iteratively generated from a MBR-based data schedule strategy, which exploits image connections to avoid redundant data IO (input/output) burden and increases the usage of GPU computing power. Third, guided by the generated image blocks, feature matching is executed sequentially within the framework of GPU-accelerated cascade hashing, and initial candidate matches are refined by combining a local geometric constraint and RANSAC-based global verification. For further performance improvement, these two seps are designed to execute parallelly in GPU and CPU. Finally, the performance of the proposed solution is evaluated by using large-scale UAV datasets. The results demonstrate that it increases the efficiency of feature matching with speedup ratios ranging from 77.0 to 100.0 compared with KD-Tree based matching methods, and achieves comparable accuracy in relative and absolute bundle adjustment (BA). The proposed algorithm is an efficient solution for feature matching of UAV images.</p></details>|[2505.22089](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22089)|null|
|**2025-05-27**|**Visual Loop Closure Detection Through Deep Graph Consensus**|<details><summary>Show Abstract</summary><p>Visual loop closure detection traditionally relies on place recognition methods to retrieve candidate loops that are validated using computationally expensive RANSAC-based geometric verification. As false positive loop closures significantly degrade downstream pose graph estimates, verifying a large number of candidates in online simultaneous localization and mapping scenarios is constrained by limited time and compute resources. While most deep loop closure detection approaches only operate on pairs of keyframes, we relax this constraint by considering neighborhoods of multiple keyframes when detecting loops. In this work, we introduce LoopGNN, a graph neural network architecture that estimates loop closure consensus by leveraging cliques of visually similar keyframes retrieved through place recognition. By propagating deep feature encodings among nodes of the clique, our method yields high-precision estimates while maintaining high recall. Extensive experimental evaluations on the TartanDrive 2.0 and NCLT datasets demonstrate that LoopGNN outperforms traditional baselines. Additionally, an ablation study across various keypoint extractors demonstrates that our method is robust, regardless of the type of deep feature encodings used, and exhibits higher computational efficiency compared to classical geometric verification baselines. We release our code, supplementary material, and keyframe data at https://loopgnn.cs.uni-freiburg.de.</p></details>|[2505.21754](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21754)|**[link](https://loopgnn.cs.uni-freiburg.de.)**|

However, these models do not perform well when used for challenging retrieval tasks, such as instance retrieval in very large-scale image collections. Recent work has shown that linear transformations of VLM features trained for instance retrieval can improve performance by emphasizing subspaces that relate to the domain of interest. In this paper, we explore a more extreme version of this specialization by learning to map a given query to a query-specific feature space transformation. Because this transformation is linear, it can be applied with minimal computational cost to millions of image embeddings, making it effective for large-scale retrieval or re-ranking. Results show that this method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art alternatives, including those that require many orders of magnitude more computation at query time.</p></details>|[2505.21647](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21647)|null|

Existing methods in CIR struggle to accurately represent the image and the text modification, resulting in subpar performance. To address this limitation, we introduce a CIR framework, ConText-CIR, trained with a Text Concept-Consistency loss that encourages the representations of noun phrases in the text modification to better attend to the relevant parts of the query image. To support training with this loss function, we also propose a synthetic data generation pipeline that creates training data from existing CIR datasets or unlabeled images. We show that these components together enable stronger performance on CIR tasks, setting a new state-of-the-art in composed image retrieval in both the supervised and zero-shot settings on multiple benchmark datasets, including CIRR and CIRCO. Source code, model checkpoints, and our new datasets are available at https://github.com/mvrl/ConText-CIR.</p></details>|[2505.20764](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20764)|**[link](https://github.com/mvrl/ConText-CIR.)**|
|**2025-05-26**|**Visualized Text-to-Image Retrieval**|<details><summary>Show Abstract</summary><p>We propose Visualize-then-Retrieve (VisRet), a new paradigm for Text-to-Image (T2I) retrieval that mitigates the limitations of cross-modal similarity alignment of existing multi-modal embeddings. VisRet first projects textual queries into the image modality via T2I generation. Then, it performs retrieval within the image modality to bypass the weaknesses of cross-modal retrievers in recognizing subtle visual-spatial features. Experiments on three knowledge-intensive T2I retrieval benchmarks, including a newly introduced multi-entity benchmark, demonstrate that VisRet consistently improves T2I retrieval by 24.5% to 32.7% NDCG@10 across different embedding models. VisRet also significantly benefits downstream visual question answering accuracy when used in retrieval-augmented generation pipelines. The method is plug-and-play and compatible with off-the-shelf retrievers, making it an effective module for knowledge-intensive multi-modal systems. Our code and the new benchmark are publicly available at https://github.com/xiaowu0162/Visualize-then-Retrieve.</p></details>|[2505.20291](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20291)|**[link](https://github.com/xiaowu0162/visualize-then-retrieve)**|
|**2025-05-26**|**Multimodal Reasoning Agent for Zero-Shot Composed Image Retrieval**|<details><summary>Show Abstract</summary><p>Zero-Shot Composed Image Retrieval (ZS-CIR) aims to retrieve target images given a compositional query, consisting of a reference image and a modifying text-without relying on annotated training data. Existing approaches often generate a synthetic target text using large language models (LLMs) to serve as an intermediate anchor between the compositional query and the target image. Models are then trained to align the compositional query with the generated text, and separately align images with their corresponding texts using contrastive learning. However, this reliance on intermediate text introduces error propagation, as inaccuracies in query-to-text and text-to-image mappings accumulate, ultimately degrading retrieval performance. To address these problems, we propose a novel framework by employing a Multimodal Reasoning Agent (MRA) for ZS-CIR. MRA eliminates the dependence on textual intermediaries by directly constructing triplets, <reference image, modification text, target image>, using only unlabeled image data. By training on these synthetic triplets, our model learns to capture the relationships between compositional queries and candidate images directly. Extensive experiments on three standard CIR benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. On the FashionIQ dataset, our method improves Average R@10 by at least 7.5\% over existing baselines; on CIRR, it boosts R@1 by 9.6\%; and on CIRCO, it increases mAP@5 by 9.5\%.</p></details>|[2505.19952](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19952)|null|
|**2025-05-26**|**Can Visual Encoder Learn to See Arrows?**|<details><summary>Show Abstract</summary><p>The diagram is a visual representation of a relationship illustrated with edges (lines or arrows), which is widely used in industrial and scientific communication. Although recognizing diagrams is essential for vision language models (VLMs) to comprehend domain-specific knowledge, recent studies reveal that many VLMs fail to identify edges in images. We hypothesize that these failures stem from an over-reliance on textual and positional biases, preventing VLMs from learning explicit edge features. Based on this idea, we empirically investigate whether the image encoder in VLMs can learn edge representation through training on a diagram dataset in which edges are biased neither by textual nor positional information. To this end, we conduct contrastive learning on an artificially generated diagram--caption dataset to train an image encoder and evaluate its diagram-related features on three tasks: probing, image retrieval, and captioning. Our results show that the finetuned model outperforms pretrained CLIP in all tasks and surpasses zero-shot GPT-4o and LLaVA-Mistral in the captioning task. These findings confirm that eliminating textual and positional biases fosters accurate edge recognition in VLMs, offering a promising path for advancing diagram understanding.</p></details>|[2505.19944](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19944)|null|

|**2025-05-21**|**Highlighting What Matters: Promptable Embeddings for Attribute-Focused Image Retrieval**|<details><summary>Show Abstract</summary><p>While an image is worth more than a thousand words, only a few provide crucial information for a given task and thus should be focused on. In light of this, ideal text-to-image (T2I) retrievers should prioritize specific visual attributes relevant to queries. To evaluate current retrievers on handling attribute-focused queries, we build COCO-Facet, a COCO-based benchmark with 9,112 queries about diverse attributes of interest. We find that CLIP-like retrievers, which are widely adopted due to their efficiency and zero-shot ability, have poor and imbalanced performance, possibly because their image embeddings focus on global semantics and subjects while leaving out other details. Notably, we reveal that even recent Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM)-based, stronger retrievers with a larger output dimension struggle with this limitation. Hence, we hypothesize that retrieving with general image embeddings is suboptimal for performing such queries. As a solution, we propose to use promptable image embeddings enabled by these multimodal retrievers, which boost performance by highlighting required attributes. Our pipeline for deriving such embeddings generalizes across query types, image pools, and base retriever architectures. To enhance real-world applicability, we offer two acceleration strategies: Pre-processing promptable embeddings and using linear approximations. We show that the former yields a 15% improvement in Recall@5 when prompts are predefined, while the latter achieves an 8% improvement when prompts are only available during inference.</p></details>|[2505.15877](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15877)|null|
|**2025-05-21**|**SCENIR: Visual Semantic Clarity through Unsupervised Scene Graph Retrieval**|<details><summary>Show Abstract</summary><p>Despite the dominance of convolutional and transformer-based architectures in image-to-image retrieval, these models are prone to biases arising from low-level visual features, such as color. Recognizing the lack of semantic understanding as a key limitation, we propose a novel scene graph-based retrieval framework that emphasizes semantic content over superficial image characteristics. Prior approaches to scene graph retrieval predominantly rely on supervised Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), which require ground truth graph pairs driven from image captions. However, the inconsistency of caption-based supervision stemming from variable text encodings undermine retrieval reliability. To address these, we present SCENIR, a Graph Autoencoder-based unsupervised retrieval framework, which eliminates the dependence on labeled training data. Our model demonstrates superior performance across metrics and runtime efficiency, outperforming existing vision-based, multimodal, and supervised GNN approaches. We further advocate for Graph Edit Distance (GED) as a deterministic and robust ground truth measure for scene graph similarity, replacing the inconsistent caption-based alternatives for the first time in image-to-image retrieval evaluation. Finally, we validate the generalizability of our method by applying it to unannotated datasets via automated scene graph generation, while substantially contributing in advancing state-of-the-art in counterfactual image retrieval.</p></details>|[2505.15867](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15867)|null|

This study presents a novel multimodal Retrieval-Augmented Generation-based framework that automates anomaly detection across various Additive Manufacturing processes leveraging retrieved information from literature, including images and descriptive text, rather than training datasets. This framework integrates text and image retrieval from scientific literature and multimodal generation models to perform zero-shot anomaly identification, classification, and explanation generation in a Laser Powder Bed Fusion setting. The proposed framework is evaluated on four L-PBF manufacturing datasets from Oak Ridge National Laboratory, featuring various printer makes, models, and materials. This evaluation demonstrates the framework's adaptability and generalizability across diverse images without requiring additional training. Comparative analysis using Qwen2-VL-2B and GPT-4o-mini as MLLM within the proposed framework highlights that GPT-4o-mini outperforms Qwen2-VL-2B and proportional random baseline in manufacturing anomalies classification. Additionally, the evaluation of the RAG system confirms that incorporating retrieval mechanisms improves average accuracy by 12% by reducing the risk of hallucination and providing additional information. The proposed framework can be continuously updated by integrating emerging research, allowing seamless adaptation to the evolving landscape of AM technologies. This scalable, automated, and zero-shot-capable framework streamlines AM anomaly analysis, enhancing efficiency and accuracy.</p></details>|[2505.13828](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13828)|null|

To address these gaps, we introduce MMS-VPR, a large-scale multimodal dataset for street-level place recognition in complex, pedestrian-only environments. The dataset comprises 78,575 annotated images and 2,512 video clips captured across 207 locations in a ~70,800 $\mathrm{m}^2$ open-air commercial district in Chengdu, China. Each image is labeled with precise GPS coordinates, timestamp, and textual metadata, and covers varied lighting conditions, viewpoints, and timeframes. MMS-VPR follows a systematic and replicable data collection protocol with minimal device requirements, lowering the barrier for scalable dataset creation. Importantly, the dataset forms an inherent spatial graph with 125 edges, 81 nodes, and 1 subgraph, enabling structure-aware place recognition. We further define two application-specific subsets -- Dataset_Edges and Dataset_Points -- to support fine-grained and graph-based evaluation tasks. Extensive benchmarks using conventional VPR models, graph neural networks, and multimodal baselines show substantial improvements when leveraging multimodal and structural cues. MMS-VPR facilitates future research at the intersection of computer vision, geospatial understanding, and multimodal reasoning.

We present a significantly improved bag-of-words (BoW) image retrieval system for ground texture localization, achieving substantially higher accuracy for global localization and higher precision and recall for loop closure detection in SLAM. Our approach leverages an approximate $k$ -means (AKM) vocabulary with soft assignment, and exploits the consistent orientation and constant scale constraints inherent to ground texture localization. Identifying the different needs of global localization vs. loop closure detection for SLAM, we present both high-accuracy and high-speed versions of our algorithm. We test the effect of each of our proposed improvements through an ablation study and demonstrate our method's effectiveness for both global localization and loop closure detection. With numerous ground texture localization systems already using BoW, our method can readily replace other generic BoW systems in their pipeline and immediately improve their results.</p></details>|[2505.11620](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11620)|null|
|**2025-05-16**|**Redundancy-Aware Pretraining of Vision-Language Foundation Models in Remote Sensing**|<details><summary>Show Abstract</summary><p>The development of foundation models through pretraining of vision-language models (VLMs) has recently attracted great attention in remote sensing (RS). VLM pretraining aims to learn image and language alignments from a large number of image-text pairs. Each pretraining image is often associated with multiple captions containing redundant information due to repeated or semantically similar phrases, resulting in increased pretraining and inference time. To overcome this, we introduce a weighted feature aggregation (WFA) strategy for VLM pretraining in RS. Our strategy aims to extract and exploit complementary information from multiple captions per image while reducing redundancies through feature aggregation with importance weighting. To calculate adaptive importance weights for different captions of each image, we propose two techniques: (i) non-parametric uniqueness and (ii) learning-based attention. In the first technique, importance weights are calculated based on the bilingual evaluation understudy (BLEU) scores of the captions to emphasize unique sentences and reduce the influence of repetitive ones. In the second technique, importance weights are learned through an attention mechanism instead of relying on hand-crafted features. The effectiveness of the proposed WFA strategy with the two techniques is analyzed in terms of downstream performance on text-to-image retrieval in RS. Experimental results show that the proposed strategy enables efficient and effective pretraining of VLMs in RS. Based on the experimental analysis, we derive guidelines for selecting appropriate techniques depending on downstream task requirements and resource constraints.

Tunnels present a uniquely difficult scenario: they are not only prone to GNSS signal loss, but also provide little features for visual localization due to their repetitive walls and poor lighting. These conditions degrade conventional vision-based and LiDAR-based systems, which rely on distinguishable environmental features. To address this, we propose a novel sensor fusion framework that integrates a thermal camera with a LiDAR to enable robust localization in tunnels and other perceptually degraded environments. The thermal camera provides resilience in low-light or smoke conditions, while the LiDAR delivers precise depth perception and structural awareness. By combining these sensors, our framework ensures continuous and accurate localization across diverse and dynamic environments. We use an Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) to fuse multi-sensor inputs, and leverages visual odometry and SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) techniques to process the sensor data, enabling robust motion estimation and mapping even in GNSS-denied environments. This fusion of sensor modalities not only enhances system resilience but also provides a scalable solution for cyber-physical systems in connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs). To validate the framework, we conduct tests in a tunnel environment, simulating sensor degradation and visibility challenges. The results demonstrate that our method sustains accurate localization where standard approaches deteriorate due to the tunnels featureless geometry. The frameworks versatility makes it a promising solution for autonomous vehicles, inspection robots, and other cyber-physical systems operating in constrained, perceptually poor environments.</p></details>|[2505.03565](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03565)|null|

Despite great progress, it is still very challenging to extract robust and discriminative visual features in scenarios with drastic lighting changes, low texture areas, or repetitive patterns. In this paper, we propose a new lightweight network called \textit{LiftFeat}, which lifts the robustness of raw descriptor by aggregating 3D geometric feature. Specifically, we first adopt a pre-trained monocular depth estimation model to generate pseudo surface normal label, supervising the extraction of 3D geometric feature in terms of predicted surface normal. We then design a 3D geometry-aware feature lifting module to fuse surface normal feature with raw 2D descriptor feature. Integrating such 3D geometric feature enhances the discriminative ability of 2D feature description in extreme conditions. Extensive experimental results on relative pose estimation, homography estimation, and visual localization tasks, demonstrate that our LiftFeat outperforms some lightweight state-of-the-art methods.

It contains rich abstract concepts to express feeling, creativity and properties that cannot be directly perceived. Yet, current research in Vision Language Models (VLMs) has not shed light on abstract-oriented language. Our research breaks new ground by uncovering its wide presence and under-estimated value, with extensive analysis. Particularly, we focus our investigation on the fashion domain, a highly-representative field with abstract expressions. By analyzing recent large-scale multimodal fashion datasets, we find that abstract terms have a dominant presence, rivaling the concrete ones, providing novel information, and being useful in the retrieval task. However, a critical challenge emerges: current general-purpose or fashion-specific VLMs are pre-trained with databases that lack sufficient abstract words in their text corpora, thus hindering their ability to effectively represent abstract-oriented language. We propose a training-free and model-agnostic method, Abstract-to-Concrete Translator (ACT), to shift abstract representations towards well-represented concrete ones in the VLM latent space, using pre-trained models and existing multimodal databases. On the text-to-image retrieval task, despite being training-free, ACT outperforms the fine-tuned VLMs in both same- and cross-dataset settings, exhibiting its effectiveness with a strong generalization capability. Moreover, the improvement introduced by ACT is consistent with various VLMs, making it a plug-and-play solution.</p></details>|[2505.03242](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03242)|**[link](https://github.com/davidetalon/fashionact)**|

Traditional vision-based approaches like Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) and Visual Odometry (VO) involve complex sensor fusion and high computational demand, whereas range-free methods like DV-HOP face accuracy and stability challenges in sparse, dynamic networks. This paper proposes LanBLoc-BMM, a navigation approach using landmark-based localization (LanBLoc) combined with a battlefield-specific motion model (BMM) and Extended Kalman Filter (EKF). Its performance is benchmarked against three state-of-the-art visual localization algorithms integrated with BMM and Bayesian filters, evaluated on synthetic and real-imitated trajectory datasets using metrics including Average Displacement Error (ADE), Final Displacement Error (FDE), and a newly introduced Average Weighted Risk Score (AWRS). LanBLoc-BMM (with EKF) demonstrates superior performance in ADE, FDE, and AWRS on real-imitated datasets. Additionally, two safe navigation methods, SafeNav-CHull and SafeNav-Centroid, are introduced by integrating LanBLoc-BMM(EKF) with a novel Risk-Aware RRT* (RAw-RRT*) algorithm for obstacle avoidance and risk exposure minimization.

However, autonomous navigation in unknown environments often suffers from scene ambiguity, environmental disturbances, and dynamic object transformation in camera localization. To address this problem, inspired by the biological brain navigation mechanism (such as grid cells, place cells, and head direction cells), we propose a novel neurobiological camera location method, namely NeuroLoc. Firstly, we designed a Hebbian learning module driven by place cells to save and replay historical information, aiming to restore the details of historical representations and solve the issue of scene fuzziness. Secondly, we utilized the head direction cell-inspired internal direction learning as multi-head attention embedding to help restore the true orientation in similar scenes. Finally, we added a 3D grid center prediction in the pose regression module to reduce the final wrong prediction. We evaluate the proposed NeuroLoc on commonly used benchmark indoor and outdoor datasets. The experimental results show that our NeuroLoc can enhance the robustness in complex environments and improve the performance of pose regression by using only a single image.</p></details>|[2505.01113](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01113)|null|

First, the method uses 3DGS to render a synthetic RGBD image at some initial pose estimate. Second, it establishes 2D-2D correspondences between the query image and this synthetic image. Third, it uses the depth map to lift the 2D-2D correspondences to 2D-3D correspondences and solves a perspective-n-point (PnP) problem to produce a final pose estimate. Results from evaluation across three existing datasets with 38 scenes and over 2,700 test images show that our method significantly reduces both inference time (by over two orders of magnitude, from more than 10 seconds to as fast as 0.1 seconds) and estimation error compared to baseline methods that use photometric loss minimization. Results also show that our method tolerates large errors in the initial pose estimate of up to 55{\deg} in rotation and 1.1 units in translation (normalized by scene scale), achieving final pose errors of less than 5{\deg} in rotation and 0.05 units in translation on 90% of images from the Synthetic NeRF and Mip-NeRF360 datasets and on 42% of images from the more challenging Tanks and Temples dataset.</p></details>|[2504.20379](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20379)|null|
|**2025-04-25**|**From Mapping to Composing: A Two-Stage Framework for Zero-shot Composed Image Retrieval**|<details><summary>Show Abstract</summary><p>Composed Image Retrieval (CIR) is a challenging multimodal task that retrieves a target image based on a reference image and accompanying modification text. Due to the high cost of annotating CIR triplet datasets, zero-shot (ZS) CIR has gained traction as a promising alternative. Existing studies mainly focus on projection-based methods, which map an image to a single pseudo-word token. However, these methods face three critical challenges: (1) insufficient pseudo-word token representation capacity, (2) discrepancies between training and inference phases, and (3) reliance on large-scale synthetic data. To address these issues, we propose a two-stage framework where the training is accomplished from mapping to composing. In the first stage, we enhance image-to-pseudo-word token learning by introducing a visual semantic injection module and a soft text alignment objective, enabling the token to capture richer and fine-grained image information. In the second stage, we optimize the text encoder using a small amount of synthetic triplet data, enabling it to effectively extract compositional semantics by combining pseudo-word tokens with modification text for accurate target image retrieval. The strong visual-to-pseudo mapping established in the first stage provides a solid foundation for the second stage, making our approach compatible with both high- and low-quality synthetic data, and capable of achieving significant performance gains with only a small amount of synthetic data. Extensive experiments were conducted on three public datasets, achieving superior performance compared to existing approaches.</p></details>|[2504.17990](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17990)|null|
|**2025-04-24**|**A Guide to Structureless Visual Localization**|<details><summary>Show Abstract</summary><p>Visual localization algorithms, i.e., methods that estimate the camera pose of a query image in a known scene, are core components of many applications, including self-driving cars and augmented / mixed reality systems. State-of-the-art visual localization algorithms are structure-based, i.e., they store a 3D model of the scene and use 2D-3D correspondences between the query image and 3D points in the model for camera pose estimation. While such approaches are highly accurate, they are also rather inflexible when it comes to adjusting the underlying 3D model after changes in the scene. Structureless localization approaches represent the scene as a database of images with known poses and thus offer a much more flexible representation that can be easily updated by adding or removing images. Although there is a large amount of literature on structure-based approaches, there is significantly less work on structureless methods. Hence, this paper is dedicated to providing the, to the best of our knowledge, first comprehensive discussion and comparison of structureless methods. Extensive experiments show that approaches that use a higher degree of classical geometric reasoning generally achieve higher pose accuracy. In particular, approaches based on classical absolute or semi-generalized relative pose estimation outperform very recent methods based on pose regression by a wide margin. Compared with state-of-the-art structure-based approaches, the flexibility of structureless methods comes at the cost of (slightly) lower pose accuracy, indicating an interesting direction for future work.</p></details>|[2504.17636](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17636)|null|
|**2025-04-23**|**Rethinking Vision Transformer for Large-Scale Fine-Grained Image Retrieval**|<details><summary>Show Abstract</summary><p>Large-scale fine-grained image retrieval (FGIR) aims to retrieve images belonging to the same subcategory as a given query by capturing subtle differences in a large-scale setting. Recently, Vision Transformers (ViT) have been employed in FGIR due to their powerful self-attention mechanism for modeling long-range dependencies. However, most Transformer-based methods focus primarily on leveraging self-attention to distinguish fine-grained details, while overlooking the high computational complexity and redundant dependencies inherent to these models, limiting their scalability and effectiveness in large-scale FGIR. In this paper, we propose an Efficient and Effective ViT-based framework, termed \textbf{EET}, which integrates token pruning module with a discriminative transfer strategy to address these limitations. Specifically, we introduce a content-based token pruning scheme to enhance the efficiency of the vanilla ViT, progressively removing background or low-discriminative tokens at different stages by exploiting feature responses and self-attention mechanism. To ensure the resulting efficient ViT retains strong discriminative power, we further present a discriminative transfer strategy comprising both \textit{discriminative knowledge transfer} and \textit{discriminative region guidance}. Using a distillation paradigm, these components transfer knowledge from a larger ``teacher'' ViT to a more efficient ``student'' model, guiding the latter to focus on subtle yet crucial regions in a cost-free manner. Extensive experiments on two widely-used fine-grained datasets and four large-scale fine-grained datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. Specifically, EET reduces the inference latency of ViT-Small by 42.7\% and boosts the retrieval performance of 16-bit hash codes by 5.15\% on the challenging NABirds dataset.</p></details>|[2504.16691](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16691)|null|

This study introduces the Media Content Atlas (MCA), a novel pipeline designed to help researchers investigate large-scale screen data beyond traditional screen-use metrics. Leveraging multimodal large language models (MLLMs), MCA enables moment-by-moment content analysis, content-based clustering, topic modeling, image retrieval, and interactive visualizations. Evaluated on 1.12 million smartphone screenshots continuously captured during screen use from 112 adults over an entire month, MCA facilitates open-ended exploration and hypothesis generation as well as hypothesis-driven investigations at an unprecedented scale. Expert evaluators underscored its usability and potential for research and intervention design, with clustering results rated 96% relevant and descriptions 83% accurate. By bridging methodological possibilities with domain-specific needs, MCA accelerates both inductive and deductive inquiry, presenting new opportunities for media and HCI research.</p></details>|[2504.16323](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16323)|**[link](https://github.com/mediacontentatlas/mediacontentatlas)**|

Differences are evident when speakers come from diverse cultures due to the unique experiences that shape perception. Machine translation of captions has pushed multilingual capabilities in vision-language models (VLMs), but data comes mainly from English speakers, indicating a perceptual bias and lack of model flexibility. In this work, we address this challenge and outline a data-efficient framework to instill multilingual VLMs with greater understanding of perceptual diversity. We specifically propose an LLM-based, multimodal recaptioning strategy that alters the object descriptions of English captions before translation. The greatest benefits are demonstrated in a targeted multimodal mechanism guided by native speaker data. By adding produced rewrites as augmentations in training, we improve on German and Japanese text-image retrieval cases studies (up to +3.5 mean recall overall, +4.7 on non-native error cases). We further propose a mechanism to analyze the specific object description differences across datasets, and we offer insights into cross-dataset and cross-language generalization.</p></details>|[2504.14359](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14359)|null|
|**2025-04-17**|**SemCORE: A Semantic-Enhanced Generative Cross-Modal Retrieval Framework with MLLMs**|<details><summary>Show Abstract</summary><p>Cross-modal retrieval (CMR) is a fundamental task in multimedia research, focused on retrieving semantically relevant targets across different modalities. While traditional CMR methods match text and image via embedding-based similarity calculations, recent advancements in pre-trained generative models have established generative retrieval as a promising alternative. This paradigm assigns each target a unique identifier and leverages a generative model to directly predict identifiers corresponding to input queries without explicit indexing. Despite its great potential, current generative CMR approaches still face semantic information insufficiency in both identifier construction and generation processes. To address these limitations, we propose a novel unified Semantic-enhanced generative Cross-mOdal REtrieval framework (SemCORE), designed to unleash the semantic understanding capabilities in generative cross-modal retrieval task. Specifically, we first construct a Structured natural language IDentifier (SID) that effectively aligns target identifiers with generative models optimized for natural language comprehension and generation. Furthermore, we introduce a Generative Semantic Verification (GSV) strategy enabling fine-grained target discrimination. Additionally, to the best of our knowledge, SemCORE is the first framework to simultaneously consider both text-to-image and image-to-text retrieval tasks within generative cross-modal retrieval. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework outperforms state-of-the-art generative cross-modal retrieval methods. Notably, SemCORE achieves substantial improvements across benchmark datasets, with an average increase of 8.65 points in Recall@1 for text-to-image retrieval.</p></details>|[2504.13172](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13172)|null|
|**2025-04-16**|**Generalized Visual Relation Detection with Diffusion Models**|<details><summary>Show Abstract</summary><p>Visual relation detection (VRD) aims to identify relationships (or interactions) between object pairs in an image. Although recent VRD models have achieved impressive performance, they are all restricted to pre-defined relation categories, while failing to consider the semantic ambiguity characteristic of visual relations. Unlike objects, the appearance of visual relations is always subtle and can be described by multiple predicate words from different perspectives, e.g., ``ride'' can be depicted as ``race'' and ``sit on'', from the sports and spatial position views, respectively. To this end, we propose to model visual relations as continuous embeddings, and design diffusion models to achieve generalized VRD in a conditional generative manner, termed Diff-VRD. We model the diffusion process in a latent space and generate all possible relations in the image as an embedding sequence. During the generation, the visual and text embeddings of subject-object pairs serve as conditional signals and are injected via cross-attention. After the generation, we design a subsequent matching stage to assign the relation words to subject-object pairs by considering their semantic similarities. Benefiting from the diffusion-based generative process, our Diff-VRD is able to generate visual relations beyond the pre-defined category labels of datasets. To properly evaluate this generalized VRD task, we introduce two evaluation metrics, i.e., text-to-image retrieval and SPICE PR Curve inspired by image captioning. Extensive experiments in both human-object interaction (HOI) detection and scene graph generation (SGG) benchmarks attest to the superiority and effectiveness of Diff-VRD.</p></details>|[2504.12100](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12100)|null|
|**2025-04-15**|**Visual Re-Ranking with Non-Visual Side Information**|<details><summary>Show Abstract</summary><p>The standard approach for visual place recognition is to use global image descriptors to retrieve the most similar database images for a given query image. The results can then be further improved with re-ranking methods that re-order the top scoring images. However, existing methods focus on re-ranking based on the same image descriptors that were used for the initial retrieval, which we argue provides limited additional signal.   In this work we propose Generalized Contextual Similarity Aggregation (GCSA), which is a graph neural network-based re-ranking method that, in addition to the visual descriptors, can leverage other types of available side information. This can for example be other sensor data (such as signal strength of nearby WiFi or BlueTooth endpoints) or geometric properties such as camera poses for database images. In many applications this information is already present or can be acquired with low effort. Our architecture leverages the concept of affinity vectors to allow for a shared encoding of the heterogeneous multi-modal input. Two large-scale datasets, covering both outdoor and indoor localization scenarios, are utilized for training and evaluation. In experiments we show significant improvement not only on image retrieval metrics, but also for the downstream visual localization task.</p></details>|[2504.11134](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11134)|**[link](https://github.com/ghanning/gcsa)**|
|**2025-04-15**|**TMCIR: Token Merge Benefits Composed Image Retrieval**|<details><summary>Show Abstract</summary><p>Composed Image Retrieval (CIR) retrieves target images using a multi-modal query that combines a reference image with text describing desired modifications. The primary challenge is effectively fusing this visual and textual information. Current cross-modal feature fusion approaches for CIR exhibit an inherent bias in intention interpretation. These methods tend to disproportionately emphasize either the reference image features (visual-dominant fusion) or the textual modification intent (text-dominant fusion through image-to-text conversion). Such an imbalanced representation often fails to accurately capture and reflect the actual search intent of the user in the retrieval results. To address this challenge, we propose TMCIR, a novel framework that advances composed image retrieval through two key innovations: 1) Intent-Aware Cross-Modal Alignment. We first fine-tune CLIP encoders contrastively using intent-reflecting pseudo-target images, synthesized from reference images and textual descriptions via a diffusion model. This step enhances the encoder ability of text to capture nuanced intents in textual descriptions. 2) Adaptive Token Fusion. We further fine-tune all encoders contrastively by comparing adaptive token-fusion features with the target image. This mechanism dynamically balances visual and textual representations within the contrastive learning pipeline, optimizing the composed feature for retrieval. Extensive experiments on Fashion-IQ and CIRR datasets demonstrate that TMCIR significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, particularly in capturing nuanced user intent.</p></details>|[2504.10995](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10995)|null|
|**2025-04-14**|**Focus on Local: Finding Reliable Discriminative Regions for Visual Place Recognition**|<details><summary>Show Abstract</summary><p>Visual Place Recognition (VPR) is aimed at predicting the location of a query image by referencing a database of geotagged images. For VPR task, often fewer discriminative local regions in an image produce important effects while mundane background regions do not contribute or even cause perceptual aliasing because of easy overlap. However, existing methods lack precisely modeling and full exploitation of these discriminative regions. In this paper, we propose the Focus on Local (FoL) approach to stimulate the performance of image retrieval and re-ranking in VPR simultaneously by mining and exploiting reliable discriminative local regions in images and introducing pseudo-correlation supervision. First, we design two losses, Extraction-Aggregation Spatial Alignment Loss (SAL) and Foreground-Background Contrast Enhancement Loss (CEL), to explicitly model reliable discriminative local regions and use them to guide the generation of global representations and efficient re-ranking. Second, we introduce a weakly-supervised local feature training strategy based on pseudo-correspondences obtained from aggregating global features to alleviate the lack of local correspondences ground truth for the VPR task. Third, we suggest an efficient re-ranking pipeline that is efficiently and precisely based on discriminative region guidance. Finally, experimental results show that our FoL achieves the state-of-the-art on multiple VPR benchmarks in both image retrieval and re-ranking stages and also significantly outperforms existing two-stage VPR methods in terms of computational efficiency.

|**2025-04-12**|**Evolved Hierarchical Masking for Self-Supervised Learning**|<details><summary>Show Abstract</summary><p>Existing Masked Image Modeling methods apply fixed mask patterns to guide the self-supervised training. As those mask patterns resort to different criteria to depict image contents, sticking to a fixed pattern leads to a limited vision cues modeling capability.This paper introduces an evolved hierarchical masking method to pursue general visual cues modeling in self-supervised learning. The proposed method leverages the vision model being trained to parse the input visual cues into a hierarchy structure, which is hence adopted to generate masks accordingly. The accuracy of hierarchy is on par with the capability of the model being trained, leading to evolved mask patterns at different training stages. Initially, generated masks focus on low-level visual cues to grasp basic textures, then gradually evolve to depict higher-level cues to reinforce the learning of more complicated object semantics and contexts. Our method does not require extra pre-trained models or annotations and ensures training efficiency by evolving the training difficulty. We conduct extensive experiments on seven downstream tasks including partial-duplicate image retrieval relying on low-level details, as well as image classification and semantic segmentation that require semantic parsing capability. Experimental results demonstrate that it substantially boosts performance across these tasks. For instance, it surpasses the recent MAE by 1.1\% in imageNet-1K classification and 1.4\% in ADE20K segmentation with the same training epochs. We also align the proposed method with the current research focus on LLMs. The proposed approach bridges the gap with large-scale pre-training on semantic demanding tasks and enhances intricate detail perception in tasks requiring low-level feature recognition.</p></details>|[2504.09155](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09155)|null|
|**2025-04-11**|**HAL-NeRF: High Accuracy Localization Leveraging Neural Radiance Fields**|<details><summary>Show Abstract</summary><p>Precise camera localization is a critical task in XR applications and robotics. Using only the camera captures as input to a system is an inexpensive option that enables localization in large indoor and outdoor environments, but it presents challenges in achieving high accuracy. Specifically, camera relocalization methods, such as Absolute Pose Regression (APR), can localize cameras with a median translation error of more than $0.5m$ in outdoor scenes. This paper presents HAL-NeRF, a high-accuracy localization method that combines a CNN pose regressor with a refinement module based on a Monte Carlo particle filter. The Nerfacto model, an implementation of Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs), is used to augment the data for training the pose regressor and to measure photometric loss in the particle filter refinement module. HAL-NeRF leverages Nerfacto's ability to synthesize high-quality novel views, significantly improving the performance of the localization pipeline. HAL-NeRF achieves state-of-the-art results that are conventionally measured as the average of the median per scene errors. The translation error was $0.025m$ and the rotation error was $0.59$ degrees and 0.04m and 0.58 degrees on the 7-Scenes dataset and Cambridge Landmarks datasets respectively, with the trade-off of increased computational time. This work highlights the potential of combining APR with NeRF-based refinement techniques to advance monocular camera relocalization accuracy.</p></details>|[2504.08901](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08901)|null|

Vision Graph Neural Networks (ViGs) offer an alternative by leveraging graph-based methodologies but are hindered by the computational bottlenecks of clustering algorithms used for edge generation. To address these issues, we propose the Hypergraph Vision Transformer (HgVT), which incorporates a hierarchical bipartite hypergraph structure into the vision transformer framework to capture higher-order semantic relationships while maintaining computational efficiency. HgVT leverages population and diversity regularization for dynamic hypergraph construction without clustering, and expert edge pooling to enhance semantic extraction and facilitate graph-based image retrieval. Empirical results demonstrate that HgVT achieves strong performance on image classification and retrieval, positioning it as an efficient framework for semantic-based vision tasks.</p></details>|[2504.08710](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08710)|null|
|**2025-04-11**|**FocalLens: Instruction Tuning Enables Zero-Shot Conditional Image Representations**|<details><summary>Show Abstract</summary><p>Visual understanding is inherently contextual -- what we focus on in an image depends on the task at hand. For instance, given an image of a person holding a bouquet of flowers, we may focus on either the person such as their clothing, or the type of flowers, depending on the context of interest. Yet, most existing image encoding paradigms represent an image as a fixed, generic feature vector, overlooking the potential needs of prioritizing varying visual information for different downstream use cases. In this work, we introduce FocalLens, a conditional visual encoding method that produces different representations for the same image based on the context of interest, expressed flexibly through natural language. We leverage vision instruction tuning data and contrastively finetune a pretrained vision encoder to take natural language instructions as additional inputs for producing conditional image representations. Extensive experiments validate that conditional image representation from FocalLens better pronounce the visual features of interest compared to generic features produced by standard vision encoders like CLIP. In addition, we show FocalLens further leads to performance improvements on a range of downstream tasks including image-image retrieval, image classification, and image-text retrieval, with an average gain of 5 and 10 points on the challenging SugarCrepe and MMVP-VLM benchmarks, respectively.</p></details>|[2504.08368](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08368)|null|

Existing methods, including semantic graph approaches, often suffer from coarse geometric representations and lack temporal robustness against noise, dynamics, and viewpoint changes. We introduce PNE-SGAN, a Probabilistic NDT-Enhanced Semantic Graph Attention Network, to overcome these limitations. PNE-SGAN enhances semantic graphs by using Normal Distributions Transform (NDT) covariance matrices as rich, discriminative geometric node features, processed via a Graph Attention Network (GAT). Crucially, it integrates graph similarity scores into a probabilistic temporal filtering framework (modeled as an HMM/Bayes filter), incorporating uncertain odometry for motion modeling and utilizing forward-backward smoothing to effectively handle ambiguities. Evaluations on challenging KITTI sequences (00 and 08) demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, achieving Average Precision of 96.2\% and 95.1\%, respectively. PNE-SGAN significantly outperforms existing methods, particularly in difficult bidirectional loop scenarios where others falter. By synergizing detailed NDT geometry with principled probabilistic temporal reasoning, PNE-SGAN offers a highly accurate and robust solution for LiDAR LCD, enhancing SLAM reliability in complex, large-scale environments.</p></details>|[2504.08280](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08280)|null|
|**2025-04-10**|**Multi-modal Reference Learning for Fine-grained Text-to-Image Retrieval**|<details><summary>Show Abstract</summary><p>Fine-grained text-to-image retrieval aims to retrieve a fine-grained target image with a given text query. Existing methods typically assume that each training image is accurately depicted by its textual descriptions. However, textual descriptions can be ambiguous and fail to depict discriminative visual details in images, leading to inaccurate representation learning. To alleviate the effects of text ambiguity, we propose a Multi-Modal Reference learning framework to learn robust representations. We first propose a multi-modal reference construction module to aggregate all visual and textual details of the same object into a comprehensive multi-modal reference. The multi-modal reference hence facilitates the subsequent representation learning and retrieval similarity computation. Specifically, a reference-guided representation learning module is proposed to use multi-modal references to learn more accurate visual and textual representations. Additionally, we introduce a reference-based refinement method that employs the object references to compute a reference-based similarity that refines the initial retrieval results. Extensive experiments are conducted on five fine-grained text-to-image retrieval datasets for different text-to-image retrieval tasks. The proposed method has achieved superior performance over state-of-the-art methods. For instance, on the text-to-person image retrieval dataset RSTPReid, our method achieves the Rank1 accuracy of 56.2\%, surpassing the recent CFine by 5.6\%.</p></details>|[2504.07718](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07718)|null|
|**2025-04-09**|**A Pointcloud Registration Framework for Relocalization in Subterranean Environments**|<details><summary>Show Abstract</summary><p>Relocalization, the process of re-establishing a robot's position within an environment, is crucial for ensuring accurate navigation and task execution when external positioning information, such as GPS, is unavailable or has been lost. Subterranean environments present significant challenges for relocalization due to limited external positioning information, poor lighting that affects camera localization, irregular and often non-distinct surfaces, and dust, which can introduce noise and occlusion in sensor data. In this work, we propose a robust, computationally friendly framework for relocalization through point cloud registration utilizing a prior point cloud map. The framework employs Intrinsic Shape Signatures (ISS) to select feature points in both the target and prior point clouds. The Fast Point Feature Histogram (FPFH) algorithm is utilized to create descriptors for these feature points, and matching these descriptors yields correspondences between the point clouds. A 3D transformation is estimated using the matched points, which initializes a Normal Distribution Transform (NDT) registration. The transformation result from NDT is further refined using the Iterative Closest Point (ICP) registration algorithm. This framework enhances registration accuracy even in challenging conditions, such as dust interference and significant initial transformations between the target and source, making it suitable for autonomous robots operating in underground mines and tunnels. This framework was validated with experiments in simulated and real-world mine datasets, demonstrating its potential for improving relocalization.</p></details>|[2504.07231](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07231)|null|
|**2025-04-09**|**Patch Matters: Training-free Fine-grained Image Caption Enhancement via Local Perception**|<details><summary>Show Abstract</summary><p>High-quality image captions play a crucial role in improving the performance of cross-modal applications such as text-to-image generation, text-to-video generation, and text-image retrieval. To generate long-form, high-quality captions, many recent studies have employed multimodal large language models (MLLMs). However, current MLLMs often produce captions that lack fine-grained details or suffer from hallucinations, a challenge that persists in both open-source and closed-source models. Inspired by Feature-Integration theory, which suggests that attention must focus on specific regions to integrate visual information effectively, we propose a \textbf{divide-then-aggregate} strategy. Our method first divides the image into semantic and spatial patches to extract fine-grained details, enhancing the model's local perception of the image. These local details are then hierarchically aggregated to generate a comprehensive global description. To address hallucinations and inconsistencies in the generated captions, we apply a semantic-level filtering process during hierarchical aggregation. This training-free pipeline can be applied to both open-source models (LLaVA-1.5, LLaVA-1.6, Mini-Gemini) and closed-source models (Claude-3.5-Sonnet, GPT-4o, GLM-4V-Plus).

While recent CIR methods have shown promise, they mainly focus on exploring relationships between the query pairs (image and text) through data augmentation or model design. These methods often assume perfect alignment between queries and target images, an idealized scenario rarely encountered in practice. In reality, pairs are often partially or completely mismatched due to issues like inaccurate modification texts, low-quality target images, and annotation errors. Ignoring these mismatches leads to numerous False Positive Pair (FFPs) denoted as noise pairs in the dataset, causing the model to overfit and ultimately reducing its performance. To address this problem, we propose the Noise-aware Contrastive Learning for CIR (NCL-CIR), comprising two key components: the Weight Compensation Block (WCB) and the Noise-pair Filter Block (NFB). The WCB coupled with diverse weight maps can ensure more stable token representations of multi-modal queries and target images. Meanwhile, the NFB, in conjunction with the Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) predicts noise pairs by evaluating loss distributions, and generates soft labels correspondingly, allowing for the design of the soft-label based Noise Contrastive Estimation (NCE) loss function. Consequently, the overall architecture helps to mitigate the influence of mismatched and partially matched samples, with experimental results demonstrating that NCL-CIR achieves exceptional performance on the benchmark datasets.</p></details>|[2504.04339](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04339)|null|

This paper presents REJEPA (Retrieval with Joint-Embedding Predictive Architecture), an innovative self-supervised framework designed for unimodal RS-CBIR. REJEPA utilises spatially distributed context token encoding to forecast abstract representations of target tokens, effectively capturing high-level semantic features and eliminating unnecessary pixel-level details. In contrast to generative methods that focus on pixel reconstruction or contrastive techniques that depend on negative pairs, REJEPA functions within feature space, achieving a reduction in computational complexity of 40-60% when compared to pixel-reconstruction baselines like Masked Autoencoders (MAE). To guarantee strong and varied representations, REJEPA incorporates Variance-Invariance-Covariance Regularisation (VICReg), which prevents encoder collapse by promoting feature diversity and reducing redundancy. The method demonstrates an estimated enhancement in retrieval accuracy of 5.1% on BEN-14K (S1), 7.4% on BEN-14K (S2), 6.0% on FMoW-RGB, and 10.1% on FMoW-Sentinel compared to prominent SSL techniques, including CSMAE-SESD, Mask-VLM, SatMAE, ScaleMAE, and SatMAE++, on extensive RS benchmarks BEN-14K (multispectral and SAR data), FMoW-RGB and FMoW-Sentinel.

In this work, we revisit temporal search paradigms for long-form video understanding and address a fundamental issue pertaining to all state-of-the-art (SOTA) long-context vision-language models (VLMs). Our contributions are twofold: First, we frame temporal search as a Long Video Haystack problem: finding a minimal set of relevant frames (e.g., one to five) from tens of thousands based on specific queries. Upon this formulation, we introduce LV-Haystack, the first dataset with 480 hours of videos, 15,092 human-annotated instances for both training and evaluation aiming to improve temporal search quality and efficiency. Results on LV-Haystack highlight a significant research gap in temporal search capabilities, with current SOTA search methods only achieving 2.1% temporal F1 score on the Longvideobench subset. Next, inspired by visual search in images, we propose a lightweight temporal search framework, T* that reframes costly temporal search as spatial search. T* leverages powerful visual localization techniques commonly used in images and introduces an adaptive zooming-in mechanism that operates across both temporal and spatial dimensions. Extensive experiments show that integrating T* with existing methods significantly improves SOTA long-form video understanding. Under an inference budget of 32 frames, T* improves GPT-4o's performance from 50.5% to 53.1% and LLaVA-OneVision-OV-72B's performance from 56.5% to 62.4% on the Longvideobench XL subset.

Especially when HD maps are used, a precise and repeatable method has to be chosen. Therefore accurate map generation but also re-localization against these maps is necessary. Due to best 3D reconstruction of the surrounding, LiDAR has become a reliable modality for localization. The latest LiDAR odometry estimation are based on iterative closest point (ICP) approaches, namely KISS-ICP and SAGE-ICP. We extend the capabilities of KISS-ICP by incorporating semantic information into the point alignment process using a generalizable approach with minimal parameter tuning. This enhancement allows us to surpass KISS-ICP in terms of absolute trajectory error (ATE), the primary metric for map accuracy. Additionally, we improve the Cartographer mapping framework to handle semantic information. Cartographer facilitates loop closure detection over larger areas, mitigating odometry drift and further enhancing ATE accuracy. By integrating semantic information into the mapping process, we enable the filtering of specific classes, such as parked vehicles, from the resulting map. This filtering improves relocalization quality by addressing temporal changes, such as vehicles being moved.</p></details>|[2504.02086](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02086)|null|

In real-world image retrieval scenarios, both query and database images often exhibit complexity, with multiple objects and intricate backgrounds. Users often want to retrieve images with specific object, which we define as the Focus-Oriented Image Retrieval (FOIR) task. While a standard image encoder can be employed to extract image features for similarity matching, it may not perform optimally in the multi-object-based FOIR task. This is because each image is represented by a single global feature vector. To overcome this, a prompt-based image retrieval solution is required. We propose an approach called Prompt-guided attention Head Selection (PHS) to leverage the head-wise potential of the multi-head attention mechanism in ViT in a promptable manner. PHS selects specific attention heads by matching their attention maps with user's visual prompts, such as a point, box, or segmentation. This empowers the model to focus on specific object of interest while preserving the surrounding visual context. Notably, PHS does not necessitate model re-training and avoids any image alteration. Experimental results show that PHS substantially improves performance on multiple datasets, offering a practical and training-free solution to enhance model performance in the FOIR task.</p></details>|[2504.01348](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01348)|null|
|**2025-04-01**|**IDMR: Towards Instance-Driven Precise Visual Correspondence in Multimodal Retrieval**|<details><summary>Show Abstract</summary><p>Multimodal retrieval systems are becoming increasingly vital for cutting-edge AI technologies, such as embodied AI and AI-driven digital content industries. However, current multimodal retrieval tasks lack sufficient complexity and demonstrate limited practical application value. It spires us to design Instance-Driven Multimodal Image Retrieval (IDMR), a novel task that requires models to retrieve images containing the same instance as a query image while matching a text-described scenario. Unlike existing retrieval tasks focused on global image similarity or category-level matching, IDMR demands fine-grained instance-level consistency across diverse contexts. To benchmark this capability, we develop IDMR-bench using real-world object tracking and first-person video data. Addressing the scarcity of training data, we propose a cross-domain synthesis method that creates 557K training samples by cropping objects from standard detection datasets. Our Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) based retrieval model, trained on 1.2M samples, outperforms state-of-the-art approaches on both traditional benchmarks and our zero-shot IDMR-bench. Experimental results demonstrate previous models' limitations in instance-aware retrieval and highlight the potential of MLLM for advanced retrieval applications. The whole training dataset, codes and models, with wide ranges of sizes, are available at https://github.com/BwLiu01/IDMR.</p></details>|[2504.00954](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00954)|**[link](https://github.com/BwLiu01/IDMR.)**|
|**2025-04-01**|**Scaling Prompt Instructed Zero Shot Composed Image Retrieval with Image-Only Data**|<details><summary>Show Abstract</summary><p>Composed Image Retrieval (CIR) is the task of retrieving images matching a reference image augmented with a text, where the text describes changes to the reference image in natural language. Traditionally, models designed for CIR have relied on triplet data containing a reference image, reformulation text, and a target image. However, curating such triplet data often necessitates human intervention, leading to prohibitive costs. This challenge has hindered the scalability of CIR model training even with the availability of abundant unlabeled data. With the recent advances in foundational models, we advocate a shift in the CIR training paradigm where human annotations can be efficiently replaced by large language models (LLMs). Specifically, we demonstrate the capability of large captioning and language models in efficiently generating data for CIR only relying on unannotated image collections. Additionally, we introduce an embedding reformulation architecture that effectively combines image and text modalities. Our model, named InstructCIR, outperforms state-of-the-art methods in zero-shot composed image retrieval on CIRR and FashionIQ datasets. Furthermore, we demonstrate that by increasing the amount of generated data, our zero-shot model gets closer to the performance of supervised baselines.</p></details>|[2504.00812](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00812)|null|
|**2025-03-31**|**CIBR: Cross-modal Information Bottleneck Regularization for Robust CLIP Generalization**|<details><summary>Show Abstract</summary><p>Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP) has achieved remarkable success in cross-modal tasks such as zero-shot image classification and text-image retrieval by effectively aligning visual and textual representations. However, the theoretical foundations underlying CLIP's strong generalization remain unclear. In this work, we address this gap by proposing the Cross-modal Information Bottleneck (CIB) framework. CIB offers a principled interpretation of CLIP's contrastive learning objective as an implicit Information Bottleneck optimization. Under this view, the model maximizes shared cross-modal information while discarding modality-specific redundancies, thereby preserving essential semantic alignment across modalities. Building on this insight, we introduce a Cross-modal Information Bottleneck Regularization (CIBR) method that explicitly enforces these IB principles during training. CIBR introduces a penalty term to discourage modality-specific redundancy, thereby enhancing semantic alignment between image and text features. We validate CIBR on extensive vision-language benchmarks, including zero-shot classification across seven diverse image datasets and text-image retrieval on MSCOCO and Flickr30K. The results show consistent performance gains over standard CLIP. These findings provide the first theoretical understanding of CLIP's generalization through the IB lens. They also demonstrate practical improvements, offering guidance for future cross-modal representation learning.</p></details>|[2503.24182](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24182)|null|

We extract keypoints from the reference image and generate a 3D reference map with 3D reconstruction of the keypoints in advance. We emphasize that the more keypoints in the 3D reference map and the smaller the error of the 3D positions of the keypoints, the higher the accuracy of the camera pose estimation. However, previous image-only methods require a huge number of images, and it is difficult to 3D-reconstruct keypoints without error due to inevitable mismatches and failures in feature matching. As a result, the 3D reference map is sparse and inaccurate. In contrast, accurate 3D reference maps can be generated by combining images and 3D sensors. Recently, 3D-LiDAR has been widely used around the world. LiDAR, which measures a large space with high density, has become inexpensive. In addition, accurately calibrated cameras are also widely used, so images that record the external parameters of the camera without errors can be easily obtained. In this paper, we propose a method to directly assign 3D LiDAR point clouds to keypoints to generate dense and accurate 3D reference maps. The proposed method avoids feature matching and achieves accurate 3D reconstruction for almost all keypoints. To estimate camera pose over a wide area, we use the wide-area LiDAR point cloud to remove points that are not visible to the camera and reduce 2D-3D correspondence errors. Using indoor and outdoor datasets, we apply the proposed method to several state-of-the-art local features and confirm that it improves the accuracy of camera pose estimation.</p></details>|[2503.23664](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23664)|null|
|**2025-03-30**|**Multiview Image-Based Localization**|<details><summary>Show Abstract</summary><p>The image retrieval (IR) approach to image localization has distinct advantages to the 3D and the deep learning (DNN) approaches: it is seen-agnostic, simpler to implement and use, has no privacy issues, and is computationally efficient. The main drawback of this approach is relatively poor localization in both position and orientation of the query camera when compared to the competing approaches. This paper represents a hybrid approach that stores only image features in the database like some IR methods, but relies on a latent 3D reconstruction, like 3D methods but without retaining a 3D scene reconstruction. The approach is based on two ideas: {\em (i)} a novel proposal where query camera center estimation relies only on relative translation estimates but not relative rotation estimates through a decoupling of the two, and {\em (ii)} a shift from computing optimal pose from estimated relative pose to computing optimal pose from multiview correspondences, thus cutting out the ``middle-man''. Our approach shows improved performance on the 7-Scenes and Cambridge Landmarks datasets while also improving on timing and memory footprint as compared to state-of-the-art.</p></details>|[2503.23577](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23577)|null|
|**2025-03-27**|**LOCORE: Image Re-ranking with Long-Context Sequence Modeling**|<details><summary>Show Abstract</summary><p>We introduce LOCORE, Long-Context Re-ranker, a model that takes as input local descriptors corresponding to an image query and a list of gallery images and outputs similarity scores between the query and each gallery image. This model is used for image retrieval, where typically a first ranking is performed with an efficient similarity measure, and then a shortlist of top-ranked images is re-ranked based on a more fine-grained similarity measure. Compared to existing methods that perform pair-wise similarity estimation with local descriptors or list-wise re-ranking with global descriptors, LOCORE is the first method to perform list-wise re-ranking with local descriptors. To achieve this, we leverage efficient long-context sequence models to effectively capture the dependencies between query and gallery images at the local-descriptor level. During testing, we process long shortlists with a sliding window strategy that is tailored to overcome the context size limitations of sequence models. Our approach achieves superior performance compared with other re-rankers on established image retrieval benchmarks of landmarks (ROxf and RPar), products (SOP), fashion items (In-Shop), and bird species (CUB-200) while having comparable latency to the pair-wise local descriptor re-rankers.</p></details>|[2503.21772](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21772)|**[link](https://github.com/MrZilinXiao/LongContextReranker)**|
|**2025-03-27**|**Fwd2Bot: LVLM Visual Token Compression with Double Forward Bottleneck**|<details><summary>Show Abstract</summary><p>In this work, we aim to compress the vision tokens of a Large Vision Language Model (LVLM) into a representation that is simultaneously suitable for (a) generative and (b) discriminative tasks, (c) is nearly lossless, and (d) is storage-efficient. We propose a novel compression approach, called Fwd2Bot, that uses the LVLM itself to compress the visual information in a task-agnostic manner. At the core of Fwd2bot there exists a "double-forward pass" training strategy, whereby, during the first forward pass, the LLM (of the LVLM) creates a bottleneck by condensing the visual information into a small number of summary tokens. Then, using the same LLM, the second forward pass processes the language instruction(s) alongside the summary tokens, used as a direct replacement for the image ones. The training signal is provided by two losses: an autoregressive one applied after the second pass that provides a direct optimization objective for compression, and a contrastive loss, applied after the first pass, that further boosts the representation strength, especially for discriminative tasks. The training is further enhanced by stage-specific adapters. We accompany the proposed method by an in-depth ablation study. Overall, Fwd2Bot results in highly-informative compressed representations suitable for both generative and discriminative tasks. For generative tasks, we offer a 2x higher compression rate without compromising the generative capabilities, setting a new state-of-the-art result. For discriminative tasks, we set a new state-of-the-art on image retrieval and compositionality.</p></details>|[2503.21757](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21757)|null|

However, most existing VPR datasets are limited to single-viewpoint scenarios, leading to reduced recognition accuracy, particularly in multi-directional driving or feature-sparse scenes. Moreover, obtaining additional data to mitigate these limitations is often expensive. This paper introduces a novel training paradigm to improve the performance of existing VPR networks by enhancing multi-view diversity within current datasets through uncertainty estimation and NeRF-based data augmentation. Specifically, we initially train NeRF using the existing VPR dataset. Then, our devised self-supervised uncertainty estimation network identifies places with high uncertainty. The poses of these uncertain places are input into NeRF to generate new synthetic observations for further training of VPR networks. Additionally, we propose an improved storage method for efficient organization of augmented and original training data. We conducted extensive experiments on three datasets and tested three different VPR backbone networks. The results demonstrate that our proposed training paradigm significantly improves VPR performance by fully utilizing existing data, outperforming other training approaches. We further validated the effectiveness of our approach on self-recorded indoor and outdoor datasets, consistently demonstrating superior results.

|**2025-03-27**|**FineCIR: Explicit Parsing of Fine-Grained Modification Semantics for Composed Image Retrieval**|<details><summary>Show Abstract</summary><p>Composed Image Retrieval (CIR) facilitates image retrieval through a multimodal query consisting of a reference image and modification text. The reference image defines the retrieval context, while the modification text specifies desired alterations. However, existing CIR datasets predominantly employ coarse-grained modification text (CoarseMT), which inadequately captures fine-grained retrieval intents. This limitation introduces two key challenges: (1) ignoring detailed differences leads to imprecise positive samples, and (2) greater ambiguity arises when retrieving visually similar images. These issues degrade retrieval accuracy, necessitating manual result filtering or repeated queries. To address these limitations, we develop a robust fine-grained CIR data annotation pipeline that minimizes imprecise positive samples and enhances CIR systems' ability to discern modification intents accurately. Using this pipeline, we refine the FashionIQ and CIRR datasets to create two fine-grained CIR datasets: Fine-FashionIQ and Fine-CIRR. Furthermore, we introduce FineCIR, the first CIR framework explicitly designed to parse the modification text. FineCIR effectively captures fine-grained modification semantics and aligns them with ambiguous visual entities, enhancing retrieval precision. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FineCIR consistently outperforms state-of-the-art CIR baselines on both fine-grained and traditional CIR benchmark datasets. Our FineCIR code and fine-grained CIR datasets are available at https://github.com/SDU-L/FineCIR.git.</p></details>|[2503.21309](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21309)|**[link](https://github.com/sdu-l/finecir)**|

However, deep hashing methods are vulnerable to malicious attacks, including adversarial and backdoor attacks. It is worth noting that these attacks typically involve altering the query images, which is not a practical concern in real-world scenarios. In this paper, we point out that even clean query images can be dangerous, inducing malicious target retrieval results, like undesired or illegal images. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to study data \textbf{p}oisoning \textbf{a}ttacks against \textbf{d}eep \textbf{hash}ing \textbf{(\textit{PADHASH})}. Specifically, we first train a surrogate model to simulate the behavior of the target deep hashing model. Then, a strict gradient matching strategy is proposed to generate the poisoned images.

|**2025-03-25**|**CoLLM: A Large Language Model for Composed Image Retrieval**|<details><summary>Show Abstract</summary><p>Composed Image Retrieval (CIR) is a complex task that aims to retrieve images based on a multimodal query. Typical training data consists of triplets containing a reference image, a textual description of desired modifications, and the target image, which are expensive and time-consuming to acquire. The scarcity of CIR datasets has led to zero-shot approaches utilizing synthetic triplets or leveraging vision-language models (VLMs) with ubiquitous web-crawled image-caption pairs. However, these methods have significant limitations: synthetic triplets suffer from limited scale, lack of diversity, and unnatural modification text, while image-caption pairs hinder joint embedding learning of the multimodal query due to the absence of triplet data. Moreover, existing approaches struggle with complex and nuanced modification texts that demand sophisticated fusion and understanding of vision and language modalities. We present CoLLM, a one-stop framework that effectively addresses these limitations. Our approach generates triplets on-the-fly from image-caption pairs, enabling supervised training without manual annotation. We leverage Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate joint embeddings of reference images and modification texts, facilitating deeper multimodal fusion. Additionally, we introduce Multi-Text CIR (MTCIR), a large-scale dataset comprising 3.4M samples, and refine existing CIR benchmarks (CIRR and Fashion-IQ) to enhance evaluation reliability. Experimental results demonstrate that CoLLM achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple CIR benchmarks and settings. MTCIR yields competitive results, with up to 15% performance improvement. Our refined benchmarks provide more reliable evaluation metrics for CIR models, contributing to the advancement of this important field.</p></details>|[2503.19910](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19910)|**[link](https://github.com/hmchuong/CoLLM)**|

Visual Odometry (VO) generalizes well in unseen environments but suffers from accumulated error in open trajectories. To address this dilemma, we introduce a new task, Scene-agnostic Pose Regression (SPR), which can achieve accurate pose regression in a flexible way while eliminating the need for retraining or databases. To benchmark SPR, we created a large-scale dataset, 360SPR, with over 200K photorealistic panoramas, 3.6M pinhole images and camera poses in 270 scenes at three different sensor heights. Furthermore, a SPR-Mamba model is initially proposed to address SPR in a dual-branch manner. Extensive experiments and studies demonstrate the effectiveness of our SPR paradigm, dataset, and model.

Based on this scene representation, we introduce a novel matching-oriented Gaussian sampling strategy and a scene-specific detector to achieve efficient and robust initial pose estimation. Furthermore, based on the initial localization results, we align the query feature map to the Gaussian feature field by dense feature matching to enable accurate localization. The experiments on indoor and outdoor datasets show that STDLoc outperforms current state-of-the-art localization methods in terms of localization accuracy and recall.</p></details>|[2503.19358](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19358)|null|

Nevertheless, due to the expensive labor cost of training data annotation, recent researchers have shifted to the challenging task of zero-shot CIR (ZS-CIR), which targets fulfilling CIR without annotated triplets. The pioneer ZS-CIR studies focus on converting the CIR task into a standard text-to-image retrieval task by pre-training a textual inversion network that can map a given image into a single pseudo-word token. Despite their significant progress, their coarse-grained textual inversion may be insufficient to capture the full content of the image accurately. To overcome this issue, in this work, we propose a novel Fine-grained Textual Inversion Network for ZS-CIR, named FTI4CIR. In particular, FTI4CIR comprises two main components: fine-grained pseudo-word token mapping and tri-wise caption-based semantic regularization. The former maps the image into a subject-oriented pseudo-word token and several attribute-oriented pseudo-word tokens to comprehensively express the image in the textual form, while the latter works on jointly aligning the fine-grained pseudo-word tokens to the real-word token embedding space based on a BLIP-generated image caption template. Extensive experiments conducted on three benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of our proposed method.</p></details>|[2503.19296](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19296)|**[link](https://github.com/ZiChao111/FTI4CIR)**|

Existing methods approach it either via grid-based classification or via image retrieval. Their performance significantly suffers when the spatial distribution of test images does not align with such choices. To address these limitations, we propose to leverage diffusion as a mechanism for image geolocalization. To avoid the problematic manifold reprojection step in diffusion, we developed a novel spherical positional encoding-decoding framework, which encodes points on a spherical surface (e.g., geolocations on Earth) into a Hilbert space of Spherical Harmonics coefficients and decodes points (geolocations) by mode-seeking. We call this type of position encoding Spherical Harmonics Dirac Delta (SHDD) Representation. We also propose a novel SirenNet-based architecture called CS-UNet to learn the conditional backward process in the latent SHDD space by minimizing a latent KL-divergence loss. We train a conditional latent diffusion model called LocDiffusion that generates geolocations under the guidance of images -- to the best of our knowledge, the first generative model for image geolocalization by diffusing geolocation information in a hidden location embedding space. We evaluate our method against SOTA image geolocalization baselines. LocDiffusion achieves competitive geolocalization performance and demonstrates significantly stronger generalizability to unseen geolocations.</p></details>|[2503.18142](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18142)|null|

Previous methods either treat the information equally or require the explicit storage of the entire context, tending to be laborious in real-world scenarios. Inspired by Mamba's inherent selectivity, we propose \textbf{CorrMamba}, a \textbf{Corr}espondence filter leveraging \textbf{Mamba}'s ability to selectively mine information from true correspondences while mitigating interference from false ones, thus achieving adaptive focus at a lower cost. To prevent Mamba from being potentially impacted by unordered keypoints that obscured its ability to mine spatial information, we customize a causal sequential learning approach based on the Gumbel-Softmax technique to establish causal dependencies between features in a fully autonomous and differentiable manner. Additionally, a local-context enhancement module is designed to capture critical contextual cues essential for correspondence pruning, complementing the core framework. Extensive experiments on relative pose estimation, visual localization, and analysis demonstrate that CorrMamba achieves state-of-the-art performance. Notably, in outdoor relative pose estimation, our method surpasses the previous SOTA by $2.58$ absolute percentage points in AUC@20\textdegree, highlighting its practical superiority.

The key challenge for ZS-CIR tasks is to modify a reference image according to manipulation text to accurately retrieve a target image, especially when the reference image is missing essential target content. In this paper, we propose a novel prediction-based mapping network, named PrediCIR, to adaptively predict the missing target visual content in reference images in the latent space before mapping for accurate ZS-CIR. Specifically, a world view generation module first constructs a source view by omitting certain visual content of a target view, coupled with an action that includes the manipulation intent derived from existing image-caption pairs. Then, a target content prediction module trains a world model as a predictor to adaptively predict the missing visual information guided by user intention in manipulating text at the latent space. The two modules map an image with the predicted relevant information to a pseudo-word token without extra supervision. Our model shows strong generalization ability on six ZS-CIR tasks. It obtains consistent and significant performance boosts ranging from 1.73% to 4.45% over the best methods and achieves new state-of-the-art results on ZS-CIR.

It is designed for indoor ground mobile robots that utilize laser Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM), ensuring process completeness and precise mapping results. For frontier search, the local-global sampling architecture based on multiple Rapidly Exploring Random Trees (RRTs) is employed. Traversability checks during RRT expansion and global RRT pruning upon map updates eliminate unreachable frontiers, reducing potential collisions and deadlocks. Adaptive sampling density adjustments, informed by obstacle distribution, enhance exploration coverage potential. For frontier point navigation, a stepwise consistent motion strategy is adopted, wherein the robot strictly drives straight on approximately equidistant line segments in the polyline path and rotates in place at segment junctions. This simplified, decoupled motion pattern improves scan-matching stability and mitigates map drift. For process control, the framework serializes frontier point selection and navigation, avoiding oscillation caused by frequent goal changes in conventional parallelized processes. The waypoint retracing mechanism is introduced to generate repeated observations, triggering loop closure detection and backend optimization in graph-based SLAM, thereby improving map consistency and precision. Experiments in both simulation and real-world scenarios validate the effectiveness of the framework. It achieves improved mapping coverage and precision in more challenging environments compared to baseline 2D exploration algorithms. It also shows robustness in supporting resource-constrained robot platforms and maintaining mapping consistency across various LiDAR field-of-view (FoV) configurations.</p></details>|[2503.17005](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17005)|null|

The sparse multi-maps are adequate for robust camera localization, however they are very poor for environment representation, they are noisy, with a high percentage of inaccurately reconstructed 3D points, including significant outliers, and more importantly with an unacceptable low density for clinical applications.   We propose a method to remove outliers and densify the maps of the state of the art for sparse endoscopy multi-map CudaSIFT-SLAM. The NN LightDepth for up-to-scale depth dense predictions are aligned with the sparse CudaSIFT submaps by means of the robust to spurious LMedS. Our system mitigates the inherent scale ambiguity in monocular depth estimation while filtering outliers, leading to reliable densified 3D maps.   We provide experimental evidence of accurate densified maps 4.15 mm RMS accuracy at affordable computing time in the C3VD phantom colon dataset. We report qualitative results on the real colonoscopy from the Endomapper dataset.</p></details>|[2503.14346](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14346)|null|

While state-of-the art methods that relies on feature matching have proven to be accurate for visual localization, its requirements for storage and compute are burdens. Scene coordinate regression (SCR) is an alternative approach that remove the barrier for storage by learning to map 2D pixels to 3D scene coordinates. Most popular SCR use Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to extract 2D descriptor, which we would argue that it miss the spatial relationship between pixels. Inspired by the success of vision transformer architecture, we present a new SCR architecture, called A-ScoRe, an Attention-based model which leverage attention on descriptor map level to produce meaningful and high-semantic 2D descriptors. Since the operation is performed on descriptor map, our model can work with multiple data modality whether it is a dense or sparse from depth-map, SLAM to Structure-from-Motion (SfM). This versatility allows A-SCoRe to operate in different kind of environments, conditions and achieve the level of flexibility that is important for mobile robots. Results show our methods achieve comparable performance with State-of-the-art methods on multiple benchmark while being light-weighted and much more flexible. Code and pre-trained models are public in our repository: https://github.com/ais-lab/A-SCoRe.</p></details>|[2503.13982](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13982)|**[link](https://github.com/ais-lab/a-score)**|

|**2025-05-28**|**Universal Domain Adaptation for Semantic Segmentation**|<details><summary>Show Abstract</summary><p>Unsupervised domain adaptation for semantic segmentation (UDA-SS) aims to transfer knowledge from labeled source data to unlabeled target data. However, traditional UDA-SS methods assume that category settings between source and target domains are known, which is unrealistic in real-world scenarios. This leads to performance degradation if private classes exist. To address this limitation, we propose Universal Domain Adaptation for Semantic Segmentation (UniDA-SS), achieving robust adaptation even without prior knowledge of category settings. We define the problem in the UniDA-SS scenario as low confidence scores of common classes in the target domain, which leads to confusion with private classes. To solve this problem, we propose UniMAP: UniDA-SS with Image Matching and Prototype-based Distinction, a novel framework composed of two key components. First, Domain-Specific Prototype-based Distinction (DSPD) divides each class into two domain-specific prototypes, enabling finer separation of domain-specific features and enhancing the identification of common classes across domains. Second, Target-based Image Matching (TIM) selects a source image containing the most common-class pixels based on the target pseudo-label and pairs it in a batch to promote effective learning of common classes. We also introduce a new UniDA-SS benchmark and demonstrate through various experiments that UniMAP significantly outperforms baselines. The code is available at \href{https://github.com/KU-VGI/UniMAP}{this https URL}.</p></details>|[2505.22458](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22458)|**[link](https://github.com/KU-VGI/UniMAP}{this)**|

Classical vs Learned Image Matching for Mobile Mapping Cameras to Textured Semantic 3D Building Models**|<details><summary>Show Abstract</summary><p>Feature matching is a necessary step for many computer vision and photogrammetry applications such as image registration, structure-from-motion, and visual localization. Classical handcrafted methods such as SIFT feature detection and description combined with nearest neighbour matching and RANSAC outlier removal have been state-of-the-art for mobile mapping cameras. With recent advances in deep learning, learnable methods have been introduced and proven to have better robustness and performance under complex conditions. Despite their growing adoption, a comprehensive comparison between classical and learnable feature matching methods for the specific task of semantic 3D building camera-to-model matching is still missing. This submission systematically evaluates the effectiveness of different feature-matching techniques in visual localization using textured CityGML LoD2 models. We use standard benchmark datasets (HPatches, MegaDepth-1500) and custom datasets consisting of facade textures and corresponding camera images (terrestrial and drone). For the latter, we evaluate the achievable accuracy of the absolute pose estimated using a Perspective-n-Point (PnP) algorithm, with geometric ground truth derived from geo-referenced trajectory data. The results indicate that the learnable feature matching methods vastly outperform traditional approaches regarding accuracy and robustness on our challenging custom datasets with zero to 12 RANSAC-inliers and zero to 0.16 area under the curve. We believe that this work will foster the development of model-based visual localization methods.

Our approach incorporates an online geometry prior to characterize pixel relationships, either along the epipolar line or through homography rectification. This enables the generation of geometry-aware features from native images, which are then projected across candidate depth hypotheses using plane sweeping. Our method geometric preconditioning effectively adapts epipolar-based features for enhanced multi-view reconstruction, without requiring the laborious multi-view training dataset creation. By aggregating learned similarities, we construct and regularize the cost volume, leading to improved multi-view surface reconstruction over traditional dense matching approaches. MV-DeepSimNets demonstrates superior performance against leading similarity learning networks and end-to-end regression models, especially in terms of generalization capabilities across both aerial and satellite imagery with varied ground sampling distances. Our pipeline is integrated into MicMac software and can be readily adopted in standard multi-resolution image matching pipelines.</p></details>|[2505.11264](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11264)|null|

The huge computation and storage costs caused by the increasing product classes limit the application of single-class unsupervised methods, necessitating the development of multi-class unsupervised methods. However, the feature similarity between normal and anomalous points from different class data leads to the feature confusion problem, which greatly hinders the performance of multi-class methods. Therefore, we introduce a multi-class point cloud anomaly detection method, named GLFM, leveraging global-local feature matching to progressively separate data that are prone to confusion across multiple classes. Specifically, GLFM is structured into three stages: Stage-I proposes an anomaly synthesis pipeline that stretches point clouds to create abundant anomaly data that are utilized to adapt the point cloud feature extractor for better feature representation. Stage-II establishes the global and local memory banks according to the global and local feature distributions of all the training data, weakening the impact of feature confusion on the establishment of the memory bank. Stage-III implements anomaly detection of test data leveraging its feature distance from global and local memory banks. Extensive experiments on the MVTec 3D-AD, Real3D-AD and actual industry parts dataset showcase our proposed GLFM's superior point cloud anomaly detection performance.

Despite great progress, it is still very challenging to extract robust and discriminative visual features in scenarios with drastic lighting changes, low texture areas, or repetitive patterns. In this paper, we propose a new lightweight network called \textit{LiftFeat}, which lifts the robustness of raw descriptor by aggregating 3D geometric feature. Specifically, we first adopt a pre-trained monocular depth estimation model to generate pseudo surface normal label, supervising the extraction of 3D geometric feature in terms of predicted surface normal. We then design a 3D geometry-aware feature lifting module to fuse surface normal feature with raw 2D descriptor feature. Integrating such 3D geometric feature enhances the discriminative ability of 2D feature description in extreme conditions. Extensive experimental results on relative pose estimation, homography estimation, and visual localization tasks, demonstrate that our LiftFeat outperforms some lightweight state-of-the-art methods.

|**2025-05-04**|**Focus What Matters: Matchability-Based Reweighting for Local Feature Matching**|<details><summary>Show Abstract</summary><p>Since the rise of Transformers, many semi-dense matching methods have adopted attention mechanisms to extract feature descriptors. However, the attention weights, which capture dependencies between pixels or keypoints, are often learned from scratch. This approach can introduce redundancy and noisy interactions from irrelevant regions, as it treats all pixels or keypoints equally. Drawing inspiration from keypoint selection processes, we propose to first classify all pixels into two categories: matchable and non-matchable. Matchable pixels are expected to receive higher attention weights, while non-matchable ones are down-weighted. In this work, we propose a novel attention reweighting mechanism that simultaneously incorporates a learnable bias term into the attention logits and applies a matchability-informed rescaling to the input value features. The bias term, injected prior to the softmax operation, selectively adjusts attention scores based on the confidence of query-key interactions. Concurrently, the feature rescaling acts post-attention by modulating the influence of each value vector in the final output. This dual design allows the attention mechanism to dynamically adjust both its internal weighting scheme and the magnitude of its output representations. Extensive experiments conducted on three benchmark datasets validate the effectiveness of our method, consistently outperforming existing state-of-the-art approaches.</p></details>|[2505.02161](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02161)|null|
|**2025-05-15**|**Mitigating Modality Bias in Multi-modal Entity Alignment from a Causal Perspective**|<details><summary>Show Abstract</summary><p>Multi-Modal Entity Alignment (MMEA) aims to retrieve equivalent entities from different Multi-Modal Knowledge Graphs (MMKGs), a critical information retrieval task. Existing studies have explored various fusion paradigms and consistency constraints to improve the alignment of equivalent entities, while overlooking that the visual modality may not always contribute positively. Empirically, entities with low-similarity images usually generate unsatisfactory performance, highlighting the limitation of overly relying on visual features. We believe the model can be biased toward the visual modality, leading to a shortcut image-matching task. To address this, we propose a counterfactual debiasing framework for MMEA, termed CDMEA, which investigates visual modality bias from a causal perspective. Our approach aims to leverage both visual and graph modalities to enhance MMEA while suppressing the direct causal effect of the visual modality on model predictions. By estimating the Total Effect (TE) of both modalities and excluding the Natural Direct Effect (NDE) of the visual modality, we ensure that the model predicts based on the Total Indirect Effect (TIE), effectively utilizing both modalities and reducing visual modality bias. Extensive experiments on 9 benchmark datasets show that CDMEA outperforms 14 state-of-the-art methods, especially in low-similarity, high-noise, and low-resource data scenarios.</p></details>|[2504.19458](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19458)|**[link](https://github.com/sutaoyu/CDMEA)**|

The system extends our previously proposed markerless navigation method from static image matching to dynamic video sequence tracking. By integrating the Atkinson-Shiffrin memory model's three-level architecture (sensory memory, working memory, and long-term memory), our system maintains continuous tracking of the femoral condyle throughout the surgical procedure, providing stable navigation support even in complex situations involving viewpoint changes, instrument occlusion, and tissue deformation. Unlike existing methods, our system operates in real-time on standard arthroscopic equipment without requiring additional tracking hardware, achieving 25.3 FPS with a latency of only 39.5 ms, representing a 3.5-fold improvement over our previous static system. For extended sequences (1000 frames), the dynamic system maintained an error of 5.3 plus-minus 1.5 pixels, compared to the static system's 12.6 plus-minus 3.7 pixels - an improvement of approximately 45 percent. For medium-length sequences (500 frames) and short sequences (100 frames), the system achieved approximately 35 percent and 19 percent accuracy improvements, respectively. Experimental results demonstrate the system overcomes limitations of traditional static matching methods, providing new technical support for improving surgical precision in ACL reconstruction.</p></details>|[2504.19398](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19398)|null|

This approach mitigates the significant viewpoint discrepancy between ground-view images and satellite map. The BEV image and satellite map are then projected into the road similarity space, where normalized cross correlation (NCC) is computed to assess the matching score.Finally, a particle filter is employed to estimate the probability distribution of the vehicle's pose.By comparing with GNSS ground truth, our localization system demonstrated stability without divergence over a long-distance test of 10 km, achieving an average lateral error of only 0.89 meters and an average planar Euclidean error of 3.41 meters. Furthermore, it maintained accurate and stable global localization even under nighttime conditions, further validating its robustness and adaptability.</p></details>|[2504.16346](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16346)|null|

While recent advancements in quantum computing offer promise for addressing NP-hard problems, existing quantum-based approaches for model fitting are either limited to a single model or consider multi-model scenarios within outlier-free datasets. This paper introduces a novel approach, the robust quantum multi-model fitting (R-QuMF) algorithm, designed to handle outliers effectively. Our method leverages the intrinsic capabilities of quantum hardware to tackle combinatorial challenges inherent in MMF tasks, and it does not require prior knowledge of the exact number of models, thereby enhancing its practical applicability. By formulating the problem as a maximum set coverage task for adiabatic quantum computers (AQC), R-QuMF outperforms existing quantum techniques, demonstrating superior performance across various synthetic and real-world 3D datasets. Our findings underscore the potential of quantum computing in addressing the complexities of MMF, especially in real-world scenarios with noisy and outlier-prone data.</p></details>|[2504.13836](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13836)|null|

The generated images often show significant errors with respect to the epipolar constraints that should be fulfilled, as given by the target pose. In this paper we address this issue by proposing a methodology to improve the geometric correctness of images generated by a diffusion model for single image NVS. We formulate a loss function based on image matching and epipolar constraints, and optimize the starting noise in a diffusion sampling process such that the generated image should both be a realistic image and fulfill geometric constraints derived from the given target pose. Our method does not require training data or fine-tuning of the diffusion models, and we show that we can apply it to multiple state-of-the-art models for single image NVS. The method is evaluated on the MegaScenes dataset and we show that geometric consistency is improved compared to the baseline models while retaining the quality of the generated images.</p></details>|[2504.08348](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08348)|null|

In addition, bulk and shear moduli from thin sections are 25 % and 30 % lower, respectively, than those derived from CT images. Beyond numerical comparisons, thin sections provide additional geological insights, including cementation, mineral phases, and weathering effects, which are not clear in CT images.

Traditionally, models designed for CIR have relied on triplet data containing a reference image, reformulation text, and a target image. However, curating such triplet data often necessitates human intervention, leading to prohibitive costs. This challenge has hindered the scalability of CIR model training even with the availability of abundant unlabeled data. With the recent advances in foundational models, we advocate a shift in the CIR training paradigm where human annotations can be efficiently replaced by large language models (LLMs). Specifically, we demonstrate the capability of large captioning and language models in efficiently generating data for CIR only relying on unannotated image collections. Additionally, we introduce an embedding reformulation architecture that effectively combines image and text modalities. Our model, named InstructCIR, outperforms state-of-the-art methods in zero-shot composed image retrieval on CIRR and FashionIQ datasets.

Firstly, observing that modeling context interaction over the entire coarse feature map elicits highly redundant computation due to the neighboring representation similarity of tokens, a covisibility-guided token condenser is introduced to adaptively aggregate tokens in light of their covisibility scores that are dynamically estimated, thereby ensuring computational efficiency while improving the representational capacity of aggregated tokens simultaneously. Secondly, considering that feature interaction with massive non-covisible areas is distracting, which may degrade feature distinctiveness, a covisibility-assisted attention mechanism is deployed to selectively suppress irrelevant message broadcast from non-covisible reduced tokens, resulting in robust and compact attention to relevant rather than all ones. Thirdly, we find that at the fine-level stage, current methods adjust only the target view's keypoints to subpixel level, while those in the source view remain restricted at the coarse level and thus not informative enough, detrimental to keypoint location-sensitive usages. A simple yet potent fine correlation module is developed to refine the matching candidates in both source and target views to subpixel level, attaining attractive performance improvement. Thorough experimentation across an array of public benchmarks affirms CoMatch's promising accuracy, efficiency, and generalizability.</p></details>|[2503.23925](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23925)|null|

Traditional SLAM approaches struggle to balance efficiency and accuracy, particularly in large-scale settings where extensive computational resources are required for scene reconstruction and Bundle Adjustment (BA). However, this scene reconstruction, in the form of sparse pointclouds of visual landmarks, is often only used within the SLAM system because navigation and planning methods require different map representations. In this work, we therefore investigate a more scalable Visual SLAM (VSLAM) approach without reconstruction, mainly based on approaches for two-view loop closures. By restricting the map to a sparse keyframed pose graph without dense geometry representations, our '2GO' system achieves efficient optimization with competitive absolute trajectory accuracy. In particular, we find that recent advancements in image matching and monocular depth priors enable very accurate trajectory optimization from two-view edges. We conduct extensive experiments on diverse datasets, including large-scale scenarios, and provide a detailed analysis of the trade-offs between runtime, accuracy, and map size. Our results demonstrate that this streamlined approach supports real-time performance, scales well in map size and trajectory duration, and effectively broadens the capabilities of VSLAM for long-duration deployments to large environments.</p></details>|[2503.16275](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16275)|null|

After rigorous cleaning, it provides 121,781 aligned electronic map-visible image pairs (512x512 pixels) with hybrid manual-automated ground truth, addressing the scarcity of scalable multimodal benchmarks. MapGlue integrates semantic context with a dual graph-guided mechanism to extract cross-modal invariant features. This structure enables global-to-local interaction, enhancing descriptor robustness against modality-specific distortions. Extensive evaluations on MapData and five public datasets demonstrate MapGlue's superiority in matching accuracy under complex conditions, outperforming state-of-the-art methods. Notably, MapGlue generalizes effectively to unseen modalities without retraining, highlighting its adaptability. This work addresses longstanding challenges in MRSI matching by combining scalable dataset construction with a robust, semantics-driven framework. Furthermore, MapGlue shows strong generalization capabilities on other modality matching tasks for which it was not specifically trained. The dataset and code are available at https://github.com/PeihaoWu/MapGlue.</p></details>|[2503.16185](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16185)|**[link](https://github.com/peihaowu/mapglue)**|
|**2025-03-19**|**PAPI-Reg: Patch-to-Pixel Solution for Efficient Cross-Modal Registration between LiDAR Point Cloud and Camera Image**|<details><summary>Show Abstract</summary><p>The primary requirement for cross-modal data fusion is the precise alignment of data from different sensors. However, the calibration between LiDAR point clouds and camera images is typically time-consuming and needs external calibration board or specific environmental features. Cross-modal registration effectively solves this problem by aligning the data directly without requiring external calibration. However, due to the domain gap between the point cloud and the image, existing methods rarely achieve satisfactory registration accuracy while maintaining real-time performance. To address this issue, we propose a framework that projects point clouds into several 2D representations for matching with camera images, which not only leverages the geometric characteristic of LiDAR point clouds more effectively but also bridge the domain gap between the point cloud and image. Moreover, to tackle the challenges of cross modal differences and the limited overlap between LiDAR point clouds and images in the image matching task, we introduce a multi-scale feature extraction network to effectively extract features from both camera images and the projection maps of LiDAR point cloud. Additionally, we propose a patch-to-pixel matching network to provide more effective supervision and achieve higher accuracy. We validate the performance of our model through experiments on the KITTI and nuScenes datasets. Our network achieves real-time performance and extremely high registration accuracy. On the KITTI dataset, our model achieves a registration accuracy rate of over 99\%.</p></details>|[2503.15285](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15285)|null|
|**2025-03-17**|**Less Biased Noise Scale Estimation for Threshold-Robust RANSAC**|<details><summary>Show Abstract</summary><p>The gold-standard for robustly estimating relative pose through image matching is RANSAC. While RANSAC is powerful, it requires setting the inlier threshold that determines whether the error of a correspondence under an estimated model is sufficiently small to be included in its consensus set. Setting this threshold is typically done by hand, and is difficult to tune without a access to ground truth data. Thus, a method capable of automatically determining the optimal threshold would be desirable. In this paper we revisit inlier noise scale estimation, which is an attractive approach as the inlier noise scale is linear to the optimal threshold. We revisit the noise scale estimation method SIMFIT and find bias in the estimate of the noise scale. In particular, we fix underestimates from using the same data for fitting the model as estimating the inlier noise, and from not taking the threshold itself into account. Secondly, since the optimal threshold within a scene is approximately constant we propose a multi-pair extension of SIMFIT++, by filtering of estimates, which improves results. Our approach yields robust performance across a range of thresholds, shown in Figure 1.</p></details>|[2503.13433](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13433)|null|
|**2025-03-17**|**SatDepth: A Novel Dataset for Satellite Image Matching**|<details><summary>Show Abstract</summary><p>Recent advances in deep-learning based methods for image matching have demonstrated their superiority over traditional algorithms, enabling correspondence estimation in challenging scenes with significant differences in viewing angles, illumination and weather conditions. However, the existing datasets, learning frameworks, and evaluation metrics for the deep-learning based methods are limited to ground-based images recorded with pinhole cameras and have not been explored for satellite images. In this paper, we present ``SatDepth'', a novel dataset that provides dense ground-truth correspondences for training image matching frameworks meant specifically for satellite images. Satellites capture images from various viewing angles and tracks through multiple revisits over a region. To manage this variability, we propose a dataset balancing strategy through a novel image rotation augmentation procedure. This procedure allows for the discovery of corresponding pixels even in the presence of large rotational differences between the images. We benchmark four existing image matching frameworks using our dataset and carry out an ablation study that confirms that the models trained with our dataset with rotation augmentation outperform (up to 40% increase in precision) the models trained with other datasets, especially when there exist large rotational differences between the images.</p></details>|[2503.12706](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12706)|**[link](https://github.com/rahuldeshmukh43/satdepth)**|

Using this LCRT multiplier, we conduct numerical simulations on images. Notably, the LCRT multiplier significantly reduces the complexity of the algorithm. Based on these we introduce the new concept of the sharpness $R^{\rm E}_{\rm sc}$ of the edge strength and continuity of images associated with the LCRT and, using it, we propose a new LCRT image edge detection method (for short, LCRT-IED method) and provide its mathematical foundation. Our experiments indicate that this sharpness $R^{\rm E}_{\rm sc}$ characterizes the macroscopic trend of edge variations of the image under consideration, while this new LCRT-IED method not only controls the overall edge strength and continuity of the image, but also excels in feature extraction in some local regions. These highlight the fundamental differences between the LCRT and the Riesz transform, which are precisely due to the multiparameter of the former. This new LCRT-IED method might be of significant importance for image feature extraction, image matching, and image refinement.</p></details>|[2503.11148](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11148)|null|
|**2025-03-13**|**Speedy MASt3R**|<details><summary>Show Abstract</summary><p>Image matching is a key component of modern 3D vision algorithms, essential for accurate scene reconstruction and localization. MASt3R redefines image matching as a 3D task by leveraging DUSt3R and introducing a fast reciprocal matching scheme that accelerates matching by orders of magnitude while preserving theoretical guarantees. This approach has gained strong traction, with DUSt3R and MASt3R collectively cited over 250 times in a short span, underscoring their impact. However, despite its accuracy, MASt3R's inference speed remains a bottleneck. On an A40 GPU, latency per image pair is 198.16 ms, mainly due to computational overhead from the ViT encoder-decoder and Fast Reciprocal Nearest Neighbor (FastNN) matching.   To address this, we introduce Speedy MASt3R, a post-training optimization framework that enhances inference efficiency while maintaining accuracy. It integrates multiple optimization techniques, including FlashMatch-an approach leveraging FlashAttention v2 with tiling strategies for improved efficiency, computation graph optimization via layer and tensor fusion having kernel auto-tuning with TensorRT (GraphFusion), and a streamlined FastNN pipeline that reduces memory access time from quadratic to linear while accelerating block-wise correlation scoring through vectorized computation (FastNN-Lite). Additionally, it employs mixed-precision inference with FP16/FP32 hybrid computations (HybridCast), achieving speedup while preserving numerical precision. Evaluated on Aachen Day-Night, InLoc, 7-Scenes, ScanNet1500, and MegaDepth1500, Speedy MASt3R achieves a 54% reduction in inference time (198 ms to 91 ms per image pair) without sacrificing accuracy. This advancement enables real-time 3D understanding, benefiting applications like mixed reality navigation and large-scale 3D scene reconstruction.</p></details>|[2503.10017](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10017)|null|

While existing methods predominantly operate on RGB images, we propose a novel network that directly processes raw images, bypassing the need for the Image Signal Processor (ISP). This approach significantly reduces hardware requirements and memory consumption, which is crucial for robotic vision systems. Our method introduces two custom-designed convolutional kernels capable of performing convolutions directly on raw images, preserving inter-channel information without converting to RGB. Experimental results show that our network outperforms existing algorithms on raw images, achieving higher accuracy and stability under large rotations and scale variations. This work represents the first attempt to develop a keypoint detection and feature description network specifically for raw images, offering a more efficient solution for resource-constrained environments.</p></details>|[2503.08673](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08673)|null|

However, the small size of annotated fMRI datasets restricts its wide application. Meanwhile, structural MRIs (sMRIs), such as 3D T1-weighted (T1w) MRI, which are commonly used and readily accessible in clinical settings, are often overlooked. To integrate the complementary information from both function and structure for improved diagnostic accuracy, we propose CINP (Contrastive Image-Network Pre-training), a framework that employs contrastive learning between sMRI and FCN. During pre-training, we incorporate masked image modeling and network-image matching to enhance visual representation learning and modality alignment. Since the CINP facilitates knowledge transfer from FCN to sMRI, we introduce network prompting. It utilizes only sMRI from suspected patients and a small amount of FCNs from different patient classes for diagnosing mental disorders, which is practical in real-world clinical scenario. The competitive performance on three mental disorder diagnosis tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of the CINP in integrating multimodal MRI information, as well as the potential of incorporating sMRI into clinical diagnosis using network prompting.</p></details>|[2503.04205](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04205)|null|

While existing 3D object detection approaches operate globally and implicitly rely on the a priori existence of metric camera poses, our method, Rooms from Motion (RfM) operates on a collection of un-posed images. By replacing the standard 2D keypoint-based matcher of structure-from-motion with an object-centric matcher based on image-derived 3D boxes, we estimate metric camera poses, object tracks, and finally produce a global, semantic 3D object map. When a priori pose is available, we can significantly improve map quality through optimization of global 3D boxes against individual observations. RfM shows strong localization performance and subsequently produces maps of higher quality than leading point-based and multi-view 3D object detection methods on CA-1M and ScanNet++, despite these global methods relying on overparameterization through point clouds or dense volumes. Rooms from Motion achieves a general, object-centric representation which not only extends the work of Cubify Anything to full scenes but also allows for inherently sparse localization and parametric mapping proportional to the number of objects in a scene.</p></details>|[2505.23756](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23756)|null|
|**2025-05-29**|**ZPressor: Bottleneck-Aware Compression for Scalable Feed-Forward 3DGS**|<details><summary>Show Abstract</summary><p>Feed-forward 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) models have recently emerged as a promising solution for novel view synthesis, enabling one-pass inference without the need for per-scene 3DGS optimization. However, their scalability is fundamentally constrained by the limited capacity of their encoders, leading to degraded performance or excessive memory consumption as the number of input views increases. In this work, we analyze feed-forward 3DGS frameworks through the lens of the Information Bottleneck principle and introduce ZPressor, a lightweight architecture-agnostic module that enables efficient compression of multi-view inputs into a compact latent state $Z$ that retains essential scene information while discarding redundancy. Concretely, ZPressor enables existing feed-forward 3DGS models to scale to over 100 input views at 480P resolution on an 80GB GPU, by partitioning the views into anchor and support sets and using cross attention to compress the information from the support views into anchor views, forming the compressed latent state $Z$ . We show that integrating ZPressor into several state-of-the-art feed-forward 3DGS models consistently improves performance under moderate input views and enhances robustness under dense view settings on two large-scale benchmarks DL3DV-10K and RealEstate10K. The video results, code and trained models are available on our project page: https://lhmd.top/zpressor.</p></details>|[2505.23734](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23734)|**[link](https://github.com/ziplab/ZPressor)**|

In contrast to traditional neural rendering pipelines that demand known camera poses and per scene optimization, or recent feed forward methods that buckle under the computational weight of dense views, our model predicts everything in one shot. A single forward pass yields a set of 3D Gaussian primitives encoding both scene geometry and appearance, and the corresponding camera intrinsics and extrinsics for each input image. This unified design scales effortlessly to casually captured, multi view datasets without any pose annotations. In extensive zero shot evaluations, AnySplat matches the quality of pose aware baselines in both sparse and dense view scenarios while surpassing existing pose free approaches. Moreover, it greatly reduce rendering latency compared to optimization based neural fields, bringing real time novel view synthesis within reach for unconstrained capture settings.Project page: https://city-super.github.io/anysplat/</p></details>|[2505.23716](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23716)|**[link](https://city-super.github.io/anysplat/)**|
|**2025-05-29**|**Mobi- $π$: Mobilizing Your Robot Learning Policy**|<details><summary>Show Abstract</summary><p>Learned visuomotor policies are capable of performing increasingly complex manipulation tasks. However, most of these policies are trained on data collected from limited robot positions and camera viewpoints. This leads to poor generalization to novel robot positions, which limits the use of these policies on mobile platforms, especially for precise tasks like pressing buttons or turning faucets. In this work, we formulate the policy mobilization problem: find a mobile robot base pose in a novel environment that is in distribution with respect to a manipulation policy trained on a limited set of camera viewpoints. Compared to retraining the policy itself to be more robust to unseen robot base pose initializations, policy mobilization decouples navigation from manipulation and thus does not require additional demonstrations. Crucially, this problem formulation complements existing efforts to improve manipulation policy robustness to novel viewpoints and remains compatible with them. To study policy mobilization, we introduce the Mobi-$\pi$ framework, which includes: (1) metrics that quantify the difficulty of mobilizing a given policy, (2) a suite of simulated mobile manipulation tasks based on RoboCasa to evaluate policy mobilization, (3) visualization tools for analysis, and (4) several baseline methods. We also propose a novel approach that bridges navigation and manipulation by optimizing the robot's base pose to align with an in-distribution base pose for a learned policy. Our approach utilizes 3D Gaussian Splatting for novel view synthesis, a score function to evaluate pose suitability, and sampling-based optimization to identify optimal robot poses. We show that our approach outperforms baselines in both simulation and real-world environments, demonstrating its effectiveness for policy mobilization.</p></details>|[2505.23692](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23692)|null|

More specifically, we develop a scene optimization algorithm for triangle soup, a collection of disconnected semi-transparent triangle primitives. Compared to the current most-widely used primitives for 3D scene representation, namely Gaussian splats, triangles allow for more expressive color interpolation, and benefit from a large algorithmic infrastructure for downstream tasks. Triangles, unlike full-rank Gaussian kernels, naturally combine to form surfaces. We formulate connectivity forces between triangles during optimization, encouraging explicit, but soft, surface continuity in 3D. We perform experiments on a representative 3D reconstruction dataset and show competitive photometric and geometric results.</p></details>|[2505.23642](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23642)|null|

However, most existing large-scale scene reconstruction methods rely on the divide-and-conquer paradigm, which often leads to the loss of global scene information and requires complex parameter tuning due to scene partitioning and local optimization. To address these limitations, we propose MixGS, a novel holistic optimization framework for large-scale 3D scene reconstruction. MixGS models the entire scene holistically by integrating camera pose and Gaussian attributes into a view-aware representation, which is decoded into fine-detailed Gaussians. Furthermore, a novel mixing operation combines decoded and original Gaussians to jointly preserve global coherence and local fidelity. Extensive experiments on large-scale scenes demonstrate that MixGS achieves state-of-the-art rendering quality and competitive speed, while significantly reducing computational requirements, enabling large-scale scene reconstruction training on a single 24GB VRAM GPU.

Our approach introduces a hierarchical LOD representation that iteratively selects optimal subsets of Gaussians based on camera distance, thus largely reducing both rendering time and GPU memory usage. We construct each LOD level by applying a depth-aware 3D smoothing filter, followed by importance-based pruning and fine-tuning to maintain visual fidelity. To further reduce memory overhead, we partition the scene into spatial chunks and dynamically load only relevant Gaussians during rendering, employing an opacity-blending mechanism to avoid visual artifacts at chunk boundaries. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on both outdoor (Hierarchical 3DGS) and indoor (Zip-NeRF) datasets, delivering high-quality renderings with reduced latency and memory requirements.</p></details>|[2505.23158](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23158)|null|
|**2025-05-29**|**Zero-P-to-3: Zero-Shot Partial-View Images to 3D Object**|<details><summary>Show Abstract</summary><p>Generative 3D reconstruction shows strong potential in incomplete observations. While sparse-view and single-image reconstruction are well-researched, partial observation remains underexplored. In this context, dense views are accessible only from a specific angular range, with other perspectives remaining inaccessible. This task presents two main challenges: (i) limited View Range: observations confined to a narrow angular scope prevent effective traditional interpolation techniques that require evenly distributed perspectives. (ii) inconsistent Generation: views created for invisible regions often lack coherence with both visible regions and each other, compromising reconstruction consistency. To address these challenges, we propose \method, a novel training-free approach that integrates the local dense observations and multi-source priors for reconstruction. Our method introduces a fusion-based strategy to effectively align these priors in DDIM sampling, thereby generating multi-view consistent images to supervise invisible views. We further design an iterative refinement strategy, which uses the geometric structures of the object to enhance reconstruction quality. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets show the superiority of our method over SOTAs, especially in invisible regions.</p></details>|[2505.23054](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23054)|null|
|**2025-05-29**|**SpatialSplat: Efficient Semantic 3D from Sparse Unposed Images**|<details><summary>Show Abstract</summary><p>A major breakthrough in 3D reconstruction is the feedforward paradigm to generate pixel-wise 3D points or Gaussian primitives from sparse, unposed images. To further incorporate semantics while avoiding the significant memory and storage costs of high-dimensional semantic features, existing methods extend this paradigm by associating each primitive with a compressed semantic feature vector. However, these methods have two major limitations: (a) the naively compressed feature compromises expressiveness, affecting the model's ability to capture fine-grained semantics, and (b) the pixel-wise primitive prediction introduces redundancy in overlapping areas, causing unnecessary memory overhead. To this end, we introduce \textbf{SpatialSplat}, a feedforward framework that produces redundancy-aware Gaussians and capitalizes on a dual-field semantic representation. Particularly, with the insight that primitives within the same instance exhibit high semantic consistency, we decompose the semantic representation into a coarse feature field that encodes uncompressed semantics with minimal primitives, and a fine-grained yet low-dimensional feature field that captures detailed inter-instance relationships. Moreover, we propose a selective Gaussian mechanism, which retains only essential Gaussians in the scene, effectively eliminating redundant primitives. Our proposed Spatialsplat learns accurate semantic information and detailed instances prior with more compact 3D Gaussians, making semantic 3D reconstruction more applicable. We conduct extensive experiments to evaluate our method, demonstrating a remarkable 60\% reduction in scene representation parameters while achieving superior performance over state-of-the-art methods. The code will be made available for future investigation.</p></details>|[2505.23044](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23044)|null|

VirT&R leverages aerial imagery captured for a target environment to train a Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) model so that dense point clouds and photo-textured meshes can be extracted. The NeRF mesh is used to create a high-fidelity simulation of the environment for piloting an unmanned ground vehicle (UGV) to virtually define a desired path. The mission can then be executed in the actual target environment by using NeRF-derived point cloud submaps associated along the path and an existing LiDAR Teach and Repeat (LT&R) framework. We benchmark the repeatability of VirT&R on over 12 km of autonomous driving data using physical markings that allow a sim-to-real lateral path-tracking error to be obtained and compared with LT&R. VirT&R achieved measured root mean squared errors (RMSE) of 19.5 cm and 18.4 cm in two different environments, which are slightly less than one tire width (24 cm) on the robot used for testing, and respective maximum errors were 39.4 cm and 47.6 cm. This was done using only the NeRF-derived teach map, demonstrating that VirT&R has similar closed-loop path-tracking performance to LT&R but does not require a human to manually teach the path to the UGV in the actual environment.</p></details>|[2505.16912](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16912)|null|

However, analyzing such footage presents the technical challenge of separating animal movement from drone motion. While non-trivial, computer vision techniques such as image registration and Structure-from-Motion (SfM) offer practical solutions. For conservationists, open-source tools that are user-friendly, require minimal setup, and deliver timely results are especially valuable for efficient data interpretation. This study evaluates three approaches: a bioimaging-based registration technique, an SfM pipeline, and a hybrid interpolation method. We apply these to a recorded escape event involving 44 plains zebras, captured in a single drone video. Using the best-performing method, we extract individual trajectories and identify key behavioral patterns: increased alignment (polarization) during escape, a brief widening of spacing just before stopping, and tighter coordination near the group's center. These insights highlight the method's effectiveness and its potential to scale to larger datasets, contributing to broader investigations of collective animal behavior.</p></details>|[2505.16882](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16882)|null|

Our method encodes 4D scenes using three orthogonal 2D feature planes that evolve over time, enabling efficient and compact spatiotemporal representation. These features are explicitly warped into a canonical space via a deformation offset field, eliminating the need for MLP-based motion modeling.   In canonical space, we replace traditional MLP decoders with a structured SH-based rendering head that synthesizes view-dependent color via attention over learned frequency bands improving both interpretability and rendering efficiency. To further enhance fidelity and temporal consistency, we introduce a transformer-guided latent diffusion module that refines the tri-plane and deformation features in a compressed latent space. This generative module denoises scene representations under ambiguous or out-of-distribution (OOD) motion, improving generalization.   Our model is trained in two stages: the diffusion module is first pre-trained independently, and then fine-tuned jointly with the full pipeline using a combination of image reconstruction, diffusion denoising, and temporal consistency losses. We demonstrate state-of-the-art results on synthetic benchmarks, surpassing recent methods such as HexPlane and 4D Gaussian Splatting in visual quality, temporal coherence, and robustness to sparse-view dynamic inputs.</p></details>|[2505.16535](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16535)|null|

However, existing online methods face challenge in prohibitive storage requirements primarily due to point-wise modeling that fails to exploit the motion properties. To address this limitation, we propose a novel Compact Gaussian Streaming (ComGS) framework, leveraging the locality and consistency of motion in dynamic scene, that models object-consistent Gaussian point motion through keypoint-driven motion representation. By transmitting only the keypoint attributes, this framework provides a more storage-efficient solution. Specifically, we first identify a sparse set of motion-sensitive keypoints localized within motion regions using a viewspace gradient difference strategy. Equipped with these keypoints, we propose an adaptive motion-driven mechanism that predicts a spatial influence field for propagating keypoint motion to neighboring Gaussian points with similar motion. Moreover, ComGS adopts an error-aware correction strategy for key frame reconstruction that selectively refines erroneous regions and mitigates error accumulation without unnecessary overhead. Overall, ComGS achieves a remarkable storage reduction of over 159 X compared to 3DGStream and 14 X compared to the SOTA method QUEEN, while maintaining competitive visual fidelity and rendering speed. Our code will be released.</p></details>|[2505.16533](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16533)|null|

However, generating complex 3D objects, such as plants, remains a considerable challenge. Current generative 3D models struggle with plant generation compared to general objects, limiting their usability in plant analysis tools, which require fine detail and accurate geometry. We introduce PlantDreamer, a novel approach to 3D synthetic plant generation, which can achieve greater levels of realism for complex plant geometry and textures than available text-to-3D models. To achieve this, our new generation pipeline leverages a depth ControlNet, fine-tuned Low-Rank Adaptation and an adaptable Gaussian culling algorithm, which directly improve textural realism and geometric integrity of generated 3D plant models. Additionally, PlantDreamer enables both purely synthetic plant generation, by leveraging L-System-generated meshes, and the enhancement of real-world plant point clouds by converting them into 3D Gaussian Splats. We evaluate our approach by comparing its outputs with state-of-the-art text-to-3D models, demonstrating that PlantDreamer outperforms existing methods in producing high-fidelity synthetic plants. Our results indicate that our approach not only advances synthetic plant generation, but also facilitates the upgrading of legacy point cloud datasets, making it a valuable tool for 3D phenotyping applications.</p></details>|[2505.15528](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15528)|null|

SEE comprises high-fidelity synthetic sonar data, complemented by a smaller subset of real-world sonar data. To facilitate flexible data acquisition, a simulated environment has been developed, enabling the generation of additional data through modifications such as the inclusion of new structures or imaging sonar configurations. This hybrid approach leverages the advantages of synthetic data, including readily available ground truth and the ability to generate diverse datasets, while bridging the simulation-to-reality gap with real-world data acquired in a similar environment. The SEE dataset comprehensively evaluates acoustic data-based methods, including mathematics-based sonar approaches and deep learning algorithms. These techniques were employed to validate the dataset, confirming its suitability for underwater 3D reconstruction. Furthermore, this paper proposes a novel modification to a state-of-the-art algorithm, demonstrating improved performance compared to existing methods.

Our method uses a hybrid representation during training. Each anchor combines a global feature from a convolutional neural network (CNN) with a local feature encoded by the multiresolution hash grids [2]. Subsequently, several shallow multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) predict the attributes of each Gaussians, including color, opacity, and covariance. To mitigate the adverse effects of transient objects on the reconstruction process, we ffne-tune a lightweight human detection network. Once ffne-tuned, this network generates a visibility map that efffciently generalizes to other transient objects (such as posters, banners, and cars) with minimal need for further adaptation. Additionally, to address the challenges posed by sky regions in outdoor scenes, we propose an effective sky-handling technique that incorporates a depth prior as a constraint. This allows the inffnitely distant sky to be represented on the surface of a large-radius sky sphere, signiffcantly reducing ffoaters caused by errors in sky reconstruction. Furthermore, we introduce a novel relocalization method that remains robust to changes in lighting conditions while estimating the camera pose of a given image within the reconstructed 3DGS scene. As a result, R3GS significantly enhances rendering ffdelity, improves both training and rendering efffciency, and reduces storage requirements. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to baseline methods on in-the-wild datasets. The code will be made open-source following the acceptance of the paper.</p></details>|[2505.15294](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15294)|null|
|**2025-05-21**|**GS2E: Gaussian Splatting is an Effective Data Generator for Event Stream Generation**|<details><summary>Show Abstract</summary><p>We introduce GS2E (Gaussian Splatting to Event), a large-scale synthetic event dataset for high-fidelity event vision tasks, captured from real-world sparse multi-view RGB images. Existing event datasets are often synthesized from dense RGB videos, which typically lack viewpoint diversity and geometric consistency, or depend on expensive, difficult-to-scale hardware setups. GS2E overcomes these limitations by first reconstructing photorealistic static scenes using 3D Gaussian Splatting, and subsequently employing a novel, physically-informed event simulation pipeline. This pipeline generally integrates adaptive trajectory interpolation with physically-consistent event contrast threshold modeling. Such an approach yields temporally dense and geometrically consistent event streams under diverse motion and lighting conditions, while ensuring strong alignment with underlying scene structures. Experimental results on event-based 3D reconstruction demonstrate GS2E's superior generalization capabilities and its practical value as a benchmark for advancing event vision research.</p></details>|[2505.15287](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15287)|null|
|**2025-05-19**|**Recollection from Pensieve: Novel View Synthesis via Learning from Uncalibrated Videos**|<details><summary>Show Abstract</summary><p>Currently almost all state-of-the-art novel view synthesis and reconstruction models rely on calibrated cameras or additional geometric priors for training. These prerequisites significantly limit their applicability to massive uncalibrated data. To alleviate this requirement and unlock the potential for self-supervised training on large-scale uncalibrated videos, we propose a novel two-stage strategy to train a view synthesis model from only raw video frames or multi-view images, without providing camera parameters or other priors. In the first stage, we learn to reconstruct the scene implicitly in a latent space without relying on any explicit 3D representation. Specifically, we predict per-frame latent camera and scene context features, and employ a view synthesis model as a proxy for explicit rendering. This pretraining stage substantially reduces the optimization complexity and encourages the network to learn the underlying 3D consistency in a self-supervised manner. The learned latent camera and implicit scene representation have a large gap compared with the real 3D world. To reduce this gap, we introduce the second stage training by explicitly predicting 3D Gaussian primitives. We additionally apply explicit Gaussian Splatting rendering loss and depth projection loss to align the learned latent representations with physically grounded 3D geometry. In this way, Stage 1 provides a strong initialization and Stage 2 enforces 3D consistency - the two stages are complementary and mutually beneficial. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, achieving high-quality novel view synthesis and accurate camera pose estimation, compared to methods that employ supervision with calibration, pose, or depth information.

While XPBD excels in simulating deformable objects due to its speed and simplicity, its nonlinear Gauss-Seidel (GS) solver often struggles with low-frequency errors, leading to instability and stalling issues, especially in high-resolution, high-stiffness simulations. Our multigrid approach addresses these issues efficiently by leveraging AMG. To reduce the computational overhead of traditional AMG, where prolongator construction can consume up to two-thirds of the runtime, we propose a lazy setup strategy that reuses prolongators across iterations based on matrix structure and physical significance. Furthermore, we introduce a simplified method for constructing near-kernel components by applying a few sweeps of iterative methods to the homogeneous equation, achieving convergence rates comparable to adaptive smoothed aggregation (adaptive-SA) at a lower computational cost. Experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly improves convergence rates and numerical stability, enabling efficient and stable high-resolution simulations of deformable objects.</p></details>|[2505.13390](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13390)|null|

Among these, 4D Gaussian Splatting (4DGS) has emerged as an appealing approach due to its ability to model high-fidelity spatial and temporal variations. However, existing methods suffer from substantial computational and memory overhead due to the redundant allocation of 4D Gaussians to static regions, which can also degrade image quality. In this work, we introduce hybrid 3D-4D Gaussian Splatting (3D-4DGS), a novel framework that adaptively represents static regions with 3D Gaussians while reserving 4D Gaussians for dynamic elements. Our method begins with a fully 4D Gaussian representation and iteratively converts temporally invariant Gaussians into 3D, significantly reducing the number of parameters and improving computational efficiency. Meanwhile, dynamic Gaussians retain their full 4D representation, capturing complex motions with high fidelity. Our approach achieves significantly faster training times compared to baseline 4D Gaussian Splatting methods while maintaining or improving the visual quality.</p></details>|[2505.13215](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13215)|null|

Conventional FLFM reconstruction methods, such as Richardson-Lucy (RL) deconvolution, exhibit poor axial resolution and signal degradation due to the ill-posed nature of the inverse problem. While data-driven approaches enhance spatial resolution by leveraging high-quality paired datasets or imposing structural priors, Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF)-based methods employ physics-informed self-supervised learning to overcome these limitations, yet they are hindered by substantial computational costs and memory demands. Therefore, we propose 3D Gaussian Adaptive Tomography (3DGAT) for FLFM, a 3D gaussian splatting based self-supervised learning framework that significantly improves the volumetric reconstruction quality of FLFM while maintaining computational efficiency. Experimental results indicate that our approach achieves higher resolution and improved reconstruction accuracy, highlighting its potential to advance FLFM imaging and broaden its applications in 3D optical microscopy.</p></details>|[2505.12875](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12875)|null|
|**2025-05-19**|**Accelerate TarFlow Sampling with GS-Jacobi Iteration**|<details><summary>Show Abstract</summary><p>Image generation models have achieved widespread applications. As an instance, the TarFlow model combines the transformer architecture with Normalizing Flow models, achieving state-of-the-art results on multiple benchmarks. However, due to the causal form of attention requiring sequential computation, TarFlow's sampling process is extremely slow. In this paper, we demonstrate that through a series of optimization strategies, TarFlow sampling can be greatly accelerated by using the Gauss-Seidel-Jacobi (abbreviated as GS-Jacobi) iteration method. Specifically, we find that blocks in the TarFlow model have varying importance: a small number of blocks play a major role in image generation tasks, while other blocks contribute relatively little; some blocks are sensitive to initial values and prone to numerical overflow, while others are relatively robust. Based on these two characteristics, we propose the Convergence Ranking Metric (CRM) and the Initial Guessing Metric (IGM): CRM is used to identify whether a TarFlow block is "simple" (converges in few iterations) or "tough" (requires more iterations); IGM is used to evaluate whether the initial value of the iteration is good. Experiments on four TarFlow models demonstrate that GS-Jacobi sampling can significantly enhance sampling efficiency while maintaining the quality of generated images (measured by FID), achieving speed-ups of 4.53x in Img128cond, 5.32x in AFHQ, 2.96x in Img64uncond, and 2.51x in Img64cond without degrading FID scores or sample quality.

The mismatch stems from the heterogeneous scale and distribution of point cloud and image features, leading to biased matching under fixed neighborhood fusion. To address this, we propose a target-scale adaptive, bidirectional symmetric retrieval mechanism. It expands the neighborhood for large targets to enhance context awareness and shrinks it for small ones to improve efficiency and suppress noise, enabling accurate cross-modal feature alignment. This mechanism explicitly establishes spatial correspondences and improves fusion accuracy. For surface detail loss, sparse labels provide limited supervision, resulting in poor predictions for small objects. We introduce an improved volume rendering pipeline based on 3D Gaussian Splatting, which takes fused features as input to render images, applies photometric consistency supervision, and jointly optimizes 2D-3D consistency. This enhances surface detail reconstruction while suppressing noise propagation. In summary, we propose TACOcc, an adaptive multi-modal fusion framework for 3D semantic occupancy prediction, enhanced by volume rendering supervision. Experiments on the nuScenes and SemanticKITTI benchmarks validate its effectiveness.</p></details>|[2505.12693](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12693)|null|

A Comparative Survey**|<details><summary>Show Abstract</summary><p>In embedded systems, robots must perceive and interpret their environment efficiently to operate reliably in real-world conditions. Visual Semantic SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) enhances standard SLAM by incorporating semantic information into the map, enabling more informed decision-making. However, implementing such systems on resource-limited hardware involves trade-offs between accuracy, computing efficiency, and power usage.   This paper provides a comparative review of recent Semantic Visual SLAM methods with a focus on their applicability to embedded platforms. We analyze three main types of architectures - Geometric SLAM, Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF), and 3D Gaussian Splatting - and evaluate their performance on constrained hardware, specifically the NVIDIA Jetson AGX Orin. We compare their accuracy, segmentation quality, memory usage, and energy consumption.   Our results show that methods based on NeRF and Gaussian Splatting achieve high semantic detail but demand substantial computing resources, limiting their use on embedded devices. In contrast, Semantic Geometric SLAM offers a more practical balance between computational cost and accuracy. The review highlights a need for SLAM algorithms that are better adapted to embedded environments, and it discusses key directions for improving their efficiency through algorithm-hardware co-design.</p></details>|[2505.12384](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12384)|null|

While high-field MRI (HF-MRI) is standard in research and clinical settings, its limited availability hinders widespread use. Low-field MRI (LF-MRI), particularly portable systems, offers a cost-effective and accessible alternative. However, existing cortical surface analysis tools are optimized for high-resolution HF-MRI and struggle with the lower signal-to-noise ratio and resolution of LF-MRI. In this work, we present a machine learning method for 3D reconstruction and analysis of portable LF-MRI across a range of contrasts and resolutions. Our method works "out of the box" without retraining. It uses a 3D U-Net trained on synthetic LF-MRI to predict signed distance functions of cortical surfaces, followed by geometric processing to ensure topological accuracy. We evaluate our method using paired HF/LF-MRI scans of the same subjects, showing that LF-MRI surface reconstruction accuracy depends on acquisition parameters, including contrast type (T1 vs T2), orientation (axial vs isotropic), and resolution. A 3mm isotropic T2-weighted scan acquired in under 4 minutes, yields strong agreement with HF-derived surfaces: surface area correlates at r=0.96, cortical parcellations reach Dice=0.98, and gray matter volume achieves r=0.93. Cortical thickness remains more challenging with correlations up to r=0.70, reflecting the difficulty of sub-mm precision with 3mm voxels. We further validate our method on challenging postmortem LF-MRI, demonstrating its robustness. Our method represents a step toward enabling cortical surface analysis on portable LF-MRI.

SFM constructs intermediate states along the FM paths using coarse output representations. During training, we introduce an orthogonal projection method to adaptively determine the temporal position of these states, and apply a principled construction strategy based on a single-segment piecewise flow. The SFM inference starts from the intermediate state rather than pure noise and focuses computation on the latter stages of the FM paths. We integrate SFM into multiple TTS models with a lightweight SFM head.

Yet the prevailing data collection paradigm-human teleoperation-remains costly and constrained by manual effort and physical robot access. We introduce Real2Render2Real (R2R2R), a novel approach for generating robot training data without relying on object dynamics simulation or teleoperation of robot hardware. The input is a smartphone-captured scan of one or more objects and a single video of a human demonstration. R2R2R renders thousands of high visual fidelity robot-agnostic demonstrations by reconstructing detailed 3D object geometry and appearance, and tracking 6-DoF object motion. R2R2R uses 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) to enable flexible asset generation and trajectory synthesis for both rigid and articulated objects, converting these representations to meshes to maintain compatibility with scalable rendering engines like IsaacLab but with collision modeling off. Robot demonstration data generated by R2R2R integrates directly with models that operate on robot proprioceptive states and image observations, such as vision-language-action models (VLA) and imitation learning policies.

Hence, we introduce a novel point cloud rendering method by predicting 2D Gaussians from point clouds. Our method incorporates two identical modules with an entire-patch architecture enabling the network to be generalized to multiple datasets. The module normalizes and initializes the Gaussians utilizing the point cloud information including normals, colors and distances. Then, splitting decoders are employed to refine the initial Gaussians by duplicating them and predicting more accurate results, making our methodology effectively accommodate sparse point clouds as well. Once trained, our approach exhibits direct generalization to point clouds across different categories. The predicted Gaussians are employed directly for rendering without additional refinement on the rendered images, retaining the benefits of 2D Gaussians.

To overcome the challenges posed by object motion and occlusion in monocular camera, we introduce a warped ray-guided dynamic object rendering consistency loss, utilizing optical flow to better constrain the dynamic modeling process. Additionally, we incorporate estimated dynamic flow to constrain the pose optimization process, improving the stability and accuracy of unbounded scene reconstruction.

Neural video codecs (NVC) create an end-to-end ML-based solution that does not rely on any handcrafted features (motion or edge-based) and have the ability to learn content-aware compression strategies, offering better adaptability and higher compression efficiency than traditional methods. This holds a great potential not only for hardware design, but also for various video streaming platforms and applications, especially video conferencing applications such as MS-Teams or Zoom that have found extensive usage in classrooms and workplaces. However, their high computational demands currently limit their use in real-time applications like video conferencing. To address this, we propose a region-of-interest (ROI) based neural video compression model that leverages 2D Gaussian Splatting. Unlike traditional codecs, 2D Gaussian Splatting is capable of real-time decoding and can be optimized using fewer data points, requiring only thousands of Gaussians for decent quality outputs as opposed to millions in 3D scenes. In this work, we designed a video pipeline that speeds up the encoding time of the previous Gaussian splatting-based image codec by 88% by using a content-aware initialization strategy paired with a novel Gaussian inter-frame redundancy-reduction mechanism, enabling Gaussian splatting to be used for a video-codec solution, the first of its kind solution in this neural video codec space.</p></details>|[2505.09324](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09324)|null|

Our JWST/NIRSpec IFU spectroscopy targeting three galaxies at $z=6-7$ detects key rest-frame optical emission lines, allowing us to derive [OII]$\lambda\lambda$3726,3729-based electron densities of $n_\mathrm{e,optical}\sim1000$ cm$^{-3}$ on average and [OIII]$\lambda$4363-based metallicities of $\mathrm{12+log(O/H)}=8.0-8.2$ in two galaxies. New ALMA Band 9/10 observations detect the [OIII]52$\mu$m line in one galaxy but do not in the others, resulting in FIR-based densities of $n_\mathrm{e,FIR}\lesssim500$ cm$^{-3}$ from the [OIII]52$\mu$m/[OIII]88$\mu$m ratios, systematically lower than the optical [OII]-based measurements. These low FIR-based densities are comparable to those at both $z\sim0$ and $z>6$ in the literature, including JADES-GS-z14-0 at $z=14.18$, suggesting little evolution up to $z\sim14$, in contrast to the increasing trend of optical-based densities with redshift. By conducting a JWST and ALMA joint analysis using emission lines detected with both telescopes, we find that the observed FIR [OIII]52,88$\mu$m luminosities are too high to be explained by the optical-based densities at which they would be significantly collisionally de-excited. Instead, a 2-zone model with distinct high- and low-density regions is required to reproduce all observed lines, indicating that FIR [OIII] emission arises predominantly from low-density gas, while optical [OIII] and [OII] lines trace both regions. We further demonstrate that the direct-$T_\mathrm{e}$ method can sometimes significantly underestimate metallicities up to 0.8 dex due to the presence of the low-density gas not fully traced by optical lines alone, highlighting the importance of combining optical and FIR lines to accurately determine gas-phase metallicities in the early universe.</p></details>|[2505.09186](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09186)|null|

Most previous methods rely on precise localization and mapping or learn from expensive real-world demonstrations. In this paper, we propose the Navigation Diffusion Policy (NavDP), an end-to-end framework trained solely in simulation and can zero-shot transfer to different embodiments in diverse real-world environments. The key ingredient of NavDP's network is the combination of diffusion-based trajectory generation and a critic function for trajectory selection, which are conditioned on only local observation tokens encoded from a shared policy transformer. Given the privileged information of the global environment in simulation, we scale up the demonstrations of good quality to train the diffusion policy and formulate the critic value function targets with contrastive negative samples. Our demonstration generation approach achieves about 2,500 trajectories/GPU per day, 20 $\times$ more efficient than real-world data collection, and results in a large-scale navigation dataset with 363.2km trajectories across 1244 scenes. Trained with this simulation dataset, NavDP achieves state-of-the-art performance and consistently outstanding generalization capability on quadruped, wheeled, and humanoid robots in diverse indoor and outdoor environments.

|**2025-05-13**|**FOCI: Trajectory Optimization on Gaussian Splats**|<details><summary>Show Abstract</summary><p>3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has recently gained popularity as a faster alternative to Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) in 3D reconstruction and view synthesis methods. Leveraging the spatial information encoded in 3DGS, this work proposes FOCI (Field Overlap Collision Integral), an algorithm that is able to optimize trajectories directly on the Gaussians themselves. FOCI leverages a novel and interpretable collision formulation for 3DGS using the notion of the overlap integral between Gaussians. Contrary to other approaches, which represent the robot with conservative bounding boxes that underestimate the traversability of the environment, we propose to represent the environment and the robot as Gaussian Splats. This not only has desirable computational properties, but also allows for orientation-aware planning, allowing the robot to pass through very tight and narrow spaces. We extensively test our algorithm in both synthetic and real Gaussian Splats, showcasing that collision-free trajectories for the ANYmal legged robot that can be computed in a few seconds, even with hundreds of thousands of Gaussians making up the environment.

Unlike conventional frame-based cameras, they produce sparse and temporally rich data streams, which enable more accurate 3D reconstruction and open up the possibility of performing reconstruction in extreme environments such as high-speed motion, low light, or high dynamic range scenes. In this survey, we provide the first comprehensive review focused exclusively on 3D reconstruction using event cameras. The survey categorises existing works into three major types based on input modality - stereo, monocular, and multimodal systems, and further classifies them by reconstruction approach, including geometry-based, deep learning-based, and recent neural rendering techniques such as Neural Radiance Fields and 3D Gaussian Splatting. Methods with a similar research focus were organised chronologically into the most subdivided groups. We also summarise public datasets relevant to event-based 3D reconstruction. Finally, we highlight current research limitations in data availability, evaluation, representation, and dynamic scene handling, and outline promising future research directions.

Current approaches face a clear limitation: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) methods produce high-quality results but require multiple views or video sequences, while video diffusion models can generate animations from single images but struggle with consistency and identity preservation. We present SVAD, a novel approach that addresses these limitations by leveraging complementary strengths of existing techniques. Our method generates synthetic training data through video diffusion, enhances it with identity preservation and image restoration modules, and utilizes this refined data to train 3DGS avatars. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that SVAD outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) single-image methods in maintaining identity consistency and fine details across novel poses and viewpoints, while enabling real-time rendering capabilities. Through our data augmentation pipeline, we overcome the dependency on dense monocular or multi-view training data typically required by traditional 3DGS approaches. Extensive quantitative, qualitative comparisons show our method achieves superior performance across multiple metrics against baseline models. By effectively combining the generative power of diffusion models with both the high-quality results and rendering efficiency of 3DGS, our work establishes a new approach for high-fidelity avatar generation from a single image input.</p></details>|[2505.05475](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05475)|**[link](https://github.com/yc4ny/SVAD)**|

Early methods based on procedural rules offered scalability but limited diversity. Recent advances in deep generative models (e.g., GANs, diffusion models) and 3D representations (e.g., NeRF, 3D Gaussians) have enabled the learning of real-world scene distributions, improving fidelity, diversity, and view consistency. Recent advances like diffusion models bridge 3D scene synthesis and photorealism by reframing generation as image or video synthesis problems. This survey provides a systematic overview of state-of-the-art approaches, organizing them into four paradigms: procedural generation, neural 3D-based generation, image-based generation, and video-based generation. We analyze their technical foundations, trade-offs, and representative results, and review commonly used datasets, evaluation protocols, and downstream applications. We conclude by discussing key challenges in generation capacity, 3D representation, data and annotations, and evaluation, and outline promising directions including higher fidelity, physics-aware and interactive generation, and unified perception-generation models. This review organizes recent advances in 3D scene generation and highlights promising directions at the intersection of generative AI, 3D vision, and embodied intelligence.

In contrast, we propose a data-driven multi-view reasoning approach that directly infers 3D scene geometry and camera poses from multi-view images. Our framework, DiffusionSfM, parameterizes scene geometry and cameras as pixel-wise ray origins and endpoints in a global frame and employs a transformer-based denoising diffusion model to predict them from multi-view inputs. To address practical challenges in training diffusion models with missing data and unbounded scene coordinates, we introduce specialized mechanisms that ensure robust learning. We empirically validate DiffusionSfM on both synthetic and real datasets, demonstrating that it outperforms classical and learning-based approaches while naturally modeling uncertainty.</p></details>|[2505.05473](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05473)|null|

Quickly achieving high-fidelity dynamic 3D reconstruction from a single viewpoint is a significant challenge in computer vision. In C-ToF radiance field reconstruction, the property of interest-depth-is not directly measured, causing an additional challenge. This problem has a large and underappreciated impact upon the optimization when using a fast primitive-based scene representation like 3D Gaussian splatting, which is commonly used with multi-view data to produce satisfactory results and is brittle in its optimization otherwise. We incorporate two heuristics into the optimization to improve the accuracy of scene geometry represented by Gaussians. Experimental results show that our approach produces accurate reconstructions under constrained C-ToF sensing conditions, including for fast motions like swinging baseball bats. https://visual.cs.brown.edu/gftorf</p></details>|[2505.05356](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05356)|**[link](https://visual.cs.brown.edu/gftorf)**|

Previous methods like COLMAP and GLOMAP are able to estimate high-precision camera poses, but suffer from poor scalability when the number of matched keypoint pairs becomes large. We identify two key factors leading to this problem: poor parallelization and computationally expensive optimization steps. To overcome these issues, we design an SfM framework that relies entirely on GPU-friendly operations, making it easily parallelizable. Moreover, each optimization step runs in time linear to the number of image pairs, independent of keypoint pairs or 3D points. Through extensive experiments, we show that FastMap is one to two orders of magnitude faster than COLMAP and GLOMAP on large-scale scenes with comparable pose accuracy.</p></details>|[2505.04612](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04612)|null|

TetWeave constructs tetrahedral grids on-the-fly via Delaunay triangulation, enabling increased flexibility compared to predefined grids. The extracted meshes are guaranteed to be watertight, two-manifold and intersection-free. The flexibility of TetWeave enables a resampling strategy that places new points where reconstruction error is high and allows to encourage mesh fairness without compromising on reconstruction error. This leads to high-quality, adaptive meshes that require minimal memory usage and few parameters to optimize. Consequently, TetWeave exhibits near-linear memory scaling relative to the vertex count of the output mesh - a substantial improvement over predefined grids. We demonstrate the applicability of TetWeave to a broad range of challenging tasks in computer graphics and vision, such as multi-view 3D reconstruction, mesh compression and geometric texture generation.</p></details>|[2505.04590](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04590)|**[link](https://github.com/AlexandreBinninger/TetWeave)**|
|**2025-05-07**|**Registration of 3D Point Sets Using Exponential-based Similarity Matrix**|<details><summary>Show Abstract</summary><p>Point cloud registration is a fundamental problem in computer vision and robotics, involving the alignment of 3D point sets captured from varying viewpoints using depth sensors such as LiDAR or structured light. In modern robotic systems, especially those focused on mapping, it is essential to merge multiple views of the same environment accurately. However, state-of-the-art registration techniques often struggle when large rotational differences exist between point sets or when the data is significantly corrupted by sensor noise. These challenges can lead to misalignments and, consequently, to inaccurate or distorted 3D reconstructions. In this work, we address both these limitations by proposing a robust modification to the classic Iterative Closest Point (ICP) algorithm. Our method, termed Exponential Similarity Matrix ICP (ESM-ICP), integrates a Gaussian-inspired exponential weighting scheme to construct a similarity matrix that dynamically adapts across iterations. This matrix facilitates improved estimation of both rotational and translational components during alignment. We demonstrate the robustness of ESM-ICP in two challenging scenarios: (i) large rotational discrepancies between the source and target point clouds, and (ii) data corrupted by non-Gaussian noise. Our results show that ESM-ICP outperforms traditional geometric registration techniques as well as several recent learning-based methods. To encourage reproducibility and community engagement, our full implementation is made publicly available on GitHub. https://github.com/aralab-unr/ESM_ICP</p></details>|[2505.04540](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04540)|**[link](https://github.com/aralab-unr/esm_icp)**|

In this work, we propose Coupled Score Distillation (CSD), a framework that couples multi-view joint distribution priors to ensure geometrically consistent 3D generation while enabling the stable and direct optimization of 3D Gaussian Splatting. Specifically, by reformulating the optimization as a multi-view joint optimization problem, we derive an effective optimization rule that effectively couples multi-view priors to guide optimization across different viewpoints while preserving the diversity of generated 3D assets. Additionally, we propose a framework that directly optimizes 3D Gaussian Splatting (3D-GS) with random initialization to generate geometrically consistent 3D content. We further employ a deformable tetrahedral grid, initialized from 3D-GS and refined through CSD, to produce high-quality, refined meshes. Quantitative and qualitative experimental results demonstrate the efficiency and competitive quality of our approach.</p></details>|[2505.04262](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04262)|null|

The hardware platform integrates a small camera, a standard airframe, offboard computation, and radio communication for manual overrides. We demonstrate FalconWing's capabilities by developing and deploying a purely vision-based control policy for autonomous landing (without IMU or motion capture) using a novel real-to-sim-to-real learning approach. Our learning approach: (1) constructs a photorealistic simulation environment via 3D Gaussian splatting trained on real-world images; (2) identifies nonlinear dynamics from vision-estimated real-flight data; and (3) trains a multi-modal Vision Transformer (ViT) policy through simulation-only imitation learning. The ViT architecture fuses single RGB image with the history of control actions via self-attention, preserving temporal context while maintaining real-time 20 Hz inference. When deployed zero-shot on the hardware platform, this policy achieves an 80% success rate in vision-based autonomous landings.

However, previous online reconstruction approaches have primarily focused on efficiency and rendering quality, overlooking the temporal consistency of their results, which often contain noticeable artifacts in static regions. This paper identifies that errors such as noise in real-world recordings affect temporal inconsistency in online reconstruction. We propose a method that enhances temporal consistency in online reconstruction from observations with temporal inconsistency which is inevitable in cameras. We show that our method restores the ideal observation by subtracting the learned error. We demonstrate that applying our method to various baselines significantly enhances both temporal consistency and rendering quality across datasets.

|**2025-05-02**|**Enhancing MHD model accuracy and CME forecasting by constraining coronal plasma properties with Faraday rotation**|<details><summary>Show Abstract</summary><p>Faraday rotation measurements of extragalactic radio sources occulted by the solar corona serve as a powerful complementary tool for probing the pre-eruption electron density and magnetic field structure. These measurements thereby allow us to refine predictions from global MHD models. In this paper, we discuss our recent study of the morphological evolution of a CME-driven shock event that occurred on August 3, 2012. Our analysis used white-light coronagraphic observations from three different vantage points in space (SOHO and STEREO A and B). Obtaining data from these spacecraft, we derived key parameters such as the radius of curvature of the driving flux rope, the shock speed, and the standoff distance from the CMEs' leading edge. A notable feature of this event was the availability of rare Faraday rotation measurements of a group of extragalactic radio sources occulted by the solar corona, which were obtained a few hours before the eruption. These observations from the VLA radio interferometer provide independent information on the integrated product of the line-of-sight magnetic field component and electron density. By modeling the shock standoff distance and using constraints from the Faraday rotation measurements, we achieve a high level of agreement between the fast-mode Mach number predicted by the Magnetohydrodynamic Algorithm outside a Sphere (MAS) code in its thermodynamic mode and the value deduced from the analysis of the 3D reconstruction of coronagraphic data, provided that appropriate correction factors (f_b = 2.4 and f_n = 0.5) are applied in advance to scale the simulated magnetic field and electron density, respectively. Our results are consistent with previous estimates and provide critical information for fine-tuning future MHD simulations.</p></details>|[2505.01080](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01080)|null|
|**2025-05-01**|**Are Minimal Radial Distortion Solvers Really Necessary for Relative Pose Estimation?**|<details><summary>Show Abstract</summary><p>Estimating the relative pose between two cameras is a fundamental step in many applications such as Structure-from-Motion. The common approach to relative pose estimation is to apply a minimal solver inside a RANSAC loop. Highly efficient solvers exist for pinhole cameras. Yet, (nearly) all cameras exhibit radial distortion. Not modeling radial distortion leads to (significantly) worse results. However, minimal radial distortion solvers are significantly more complex than pinhole solvers, both in terms of run-time and implementation efforts. This paper compares radial distortion solvers with two simple-to-implement approaches that do not use minimal radial distortion solvers: The first approach combines an efficient pinhole solver with sampled radial undistortion parameters, where the sampled parameters are used for undistortion prior to applying the pinhole solver. The second approach uses a state-of-the-art neural network to estimate the distortion parameters rather than sampling them from a set of potential values. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets, and different camera setups, show that complex minimal radial distortion solvers are not necessary in practice. We discuss under which conditions a simple sampling of radial undistortion parameters is preferable over calibrating cameras using a learning-based prior approach. Code and newly created benchmark for relative pose estimation under radial distortion are available at https://github.com/kocurvik/rdnet.</p></details>|[2505.00866](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00866)|**[link](https://github.com/kocurvik/rdnet.)**|

To this end, we propose Pixel3DMM, a set of highly-generalized vision transformers which predict per-pixel geometric cues in order to constrain the optimization of a 3D morphable face model (3DMM). We exploit the latent features of the DINO foundation model, and introduce a tailored surface normal and uv-coordinate prediction head. We train our model by registering three high-quality 3D face datasets against the FLAME mesh topology, which results in a total of over 1,000 identities and 976K images. For 3D face reconstruction, we propose a FLAME fitting opitmization that solves for the 3DMM parameters from the uv-coordinate and normal estimates. To evaluate our method, we introduce a new benchmark for single-image face reconstruction, which features high diversity facial expressions, viewing angles, and ethnicities. Crucially, our benchmark is the first to evaluate both posed and neutral facial geometry. Ultimately, our method outperforms the most competitive baselines by over 15% in terms of geometric accuracy for posed facial expressions.</p></details>|[2505.00615](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00615)|null|

However, existing methods still face substantial challenges in capturing fine geometric details and maintaining animation stability, particularly under dynamic or complex poses. To address these issues, we propose a novel real-time framework for animatable human avatar reconstruction based on 2D Gaussian Splatting (2DGS). By leveraging 2DGS and global SMPL pose parameters, our framework not only aligns positional and rotational discrepancies but also enables robust and natural pose-driven animation of the reconstructed avatars. Furthermore, we introduce a Rotation Compensation Network (RCN) that learns rotation residuals by integrating local geometric features with global pose parameters. This network significantly improves the handling of non-rigid deformations and ensures smooth, artifact-free pose transitions during animation. Experimental results demonstrate that our method successfully reconstructs realistic and highly animatable human avatars from monocular videos, effectively preserving fine-grained details while ensuring stable and natural pose variation.

Top-performing methods currently integrate 2D segmentation with geometry-aware 3D primitives. However, the advantage would be lost without high-fidelity 3D point clouds, such as methods based on Neural Radiance Field (NeRF). These methods are limited by the insufficient capacity to maintain consistency across partial observations. To address this, recent works have utilized contrastive loss or cross-view association pre-processing for view consensus. In contrast to them, we present Cues3D, a compact approach that relies solely on NeRF instead of pre-associations. The core idea is that NeRF's implicit 3D field inherently establishes a globally consistent geometry, enabling effective object distinction without explicit cross-view supervision. We propose a three-phase training framework for NeRF, initialization-disambiguation-refinement, whereby the instance IDs are corrected using the initially-learned knowledge. Additionally, an instance disambiguation method is proposed to match NeRF-rendered 3D masks and ensure globally unique 3D instance identities. With the aid of Cues3D, we obtain highly consistent and unique 3D instance ID for each object across views with a balanced version of NeRF. Our experiments are conducted on ScanNet v2, ScanNet200, ScanNet++, and Replica datasets for 3D instance, panoptic, and semantic segmentation tasks. Cues3D outperforms other 2D image-based methods and competes with the latest 2D-3D merging based methods, while even surpassing them when using additional 3D point clouds.

The fundamental challenge in CGH is solving the inverse problem of phase retrieval from intensity measurements. Physics-inspired neural networks (PINNs), especially Gerchberg-Saxton-based PINNs (GS-PINNs), have advanced phase retrieval capabilities. However, their performance strongly depends on forward models (FMs) and their hyperparameters (FMHs), limiting generalization, complicating benchmarking, and hindering hardware optimization. We present a systematic sensitivity analysis framework based on Saltelli's extension of Sobol's method to quantify FMH impacts on GS-PINN performance. Our analysis demonstrates that SLM pixel-resolution is the primary factor affecting neural network sensitivity, followed by pixel-pitch, propagation distance, and wavelength. Free space propagation forward models demonstrate superior neural network performance compared to Fourier holography, providing enhanced parameterization and generalization. We introduce a composite evaluation metric combining performance consistency, generalization capability, and hyperparameter perturbation resilience, establishing a unified benchmarking standard across CGH configurations. Our research connects physics-inspired deep learning theory with practical CGH implementations through concrete guidelines for forward model selection, neural network architecture, and performance evaluation.

Nonetheless, existing diffusion models predominantly concentrate on modeling static 3D scenes or object-level dynamics, constraining their capacity to provide truly immersive experiences. To address this issue, we propose HoloTime, a framework that integrates video diffusion models to generate panoramic videos from a single prompt or reference image, along with a 360-degree 4D scene reconstruction method that seamlessly transforms the generated panoramic video into 4D assets, enabling a fully immersive 4D experience for users. Specifically, to tame video diffusion models for generating high-fidelity panoramic videos, we introduce the 360World dataset, the first comprehensive collection of panoramic videos suitable for downstream 4D scene reconstruction tasks. With this curated dataset, we propose Panoramic Animator, a two-stage image-to-video diffusion model that can convert panoramic images into high-quality panoramic videos. Following this, we present Panoramic Space-Time Reconstruction, which leverages a space-time depth estimation method to transform the generated panoramic videos into 4D point clouds, enabling the optimization of a holistic 4D Gaussian Splatting representation to reconstruct spatially and temporally consistent 4D scenes. To validate the efficacy of our method, we conducted a comparative analysis with existing approaches, revealing its superiority in both panoramic video generation and 4D scene reconstruction.

This paper presents the first systematic study of backdoor threats in 3DGS pipelines. We identify that adversaries may implant backdoor views to induce malicious scene confusion during inference, potentially leading to environmental misperception in autonomous navigation or spatial distortion in immersive environments. To uncover this risk, we propose GuassTrap, a novel poisoning attack method targeting 3DGS models. GuassTrap injects malicious views at specific attack viewpoints while preserving high-quality rendering in non-target views, ensuring minimal detectability and maximizing potential harm. Specifically, the proposed method consists of a three-stage pipeline (attack, stabilization, and normal training) to implant stealthy, viewpoint-consistent poisoned renderings in 3DGS, jointly optimizing attack efficacy and perceptual realism to expose security risks in 3D rendering. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that GuassTrap can effectively embed imperceptible yet harmful backdoor views while maintaining high-quality rendering in normal views, validating its robustness, adaptability, and practical applicability.</p></details>|[2504.20829](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20829)|null|
|**2025-04-29**|**EfficientHuman: Efficient Training and Reconstruction of Moving Human using Articulated 2D Gaussian**|<details><summary>Show Abstract</summary><p>3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has been recognized as a pioneering technique in scene reconstruction and novel view synthesis. Recent work on reconstructing the 3D human body using 3DGS attempts to leverage prior information on human pose to enhance rendering quality and improve training speed. However, it struggles to effectively fit dynamic surface planes due to multi-view inconsistency and redundant Gaussians. This inconsistency arises because Gaussian ellipsoids cannot accurately represent the surfaces of dynamic objects, which hinders the rapid reconstruction of the dynamic human body. Meanwhile, the prevalence of redundant Gaussians means that the training time of these works is still not ideal for quickly fitting a dynamic human body. To address these, we propose EfficientHuman, a model that quickly accomplishes the dynamic reconstruction of the human body using Articulated 2D Gaussian while ensuring high rendering quality. The key innovation involves encoding Gaussian splats as Articulated 2D Gaussian surfels in canonical space and then transforming them to pose space via Linear Blend Skinning (LBS) to achieve efficient pose transformations. Unlike 3D Gaussians, Articulated 2D Gaussian surfels can quickly conform to the dynamic human body while ensuring view-consistent geometries. Additionally, we introduce a pose calibration module and an LBS optimization module to achieve precise fitting of dynamic human poses, enhancing the model's performance. Extensive experiments on the ZJU-MoCap dataset demonstrate that EfficientHuman achieves rapid 3D dynamic human reconstruction in less than a minute on average, which is 20 seconds faster than the current state-of-the-art method, while also reducing the number of redundant Gaussians.</p></details>|[2504.20607](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20607)|null|

However, reliable camera pose estimation and scene reconstruction from such unconstrained videos remains an open challenge. Existing visual-only SLAM methods perform well on benchmark datasets but struggle with real-world footage which often exhibits uncontrolled motion including rapid rotations and pure forward movements, textureless regions, and dynamic objects. We analyze the limitations of current methods and introduce a robust pipeline designed to improve 3D reconstruction from casual videos. We build upon recent deep visual odometry methods but increase robustness in several ways. Camera intrinsics are automatically recovered from the first few frames using structure-from-motion. Dynamic objects and less-constrained areas are masked with a predictive model. Additionally, we leverage monocular depth estimates to regularize bundle adjustment, mitigating errors in low-parallax situations. Finally, we integrate place recognition and loop closure to reduce long-term drift and refine both intrinsics and pose estimates through global bundle adjustment. We demonstrate large-scale contiguous 3D models from several online videos in various environments. In contrast, baseline methods typically produce locally inconsistent results at several points, producing separate segments or distorted maps. In lieu of ground-truth pose data, we evaluate map consistency, execution time and visual accuracy of re-rendered NeRF models. Our proposed system establishes a new baseline for visual reconstruction from casual uncontrolled videos found online, demonstrating more consistent reconstructions over longer sequences of in-the-wild videos than previously achieved.</p></details>|[2504.20496](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20496)|null|
|**2025-04-29**|**Creating Your Editable 3D Photorealistic Avatar with Tetrahedron-constrained Gaussian Splatting**|<details><summary>Show Abstract</summary><p>Personalized 3D avatar editing holds significant promise due to its user-friendliness and availability to applications such as AR/VR and virtual try-ons. Previous studies have explored the feasibility of 3D editing, but often struggle to generate visually pleasing results, possibly due to the unstable representation learning under mixed optimization of geometry and texture in complicated reconstructed scenarios. In this paper, we aim to provide an accessible solution for ordinary users to create their editable 3D avatars with precise region localization, geometric adaptability, and photorealistic renderings. To tackle this challenge, we introduce a meticulously designed framework that decouples the editing process into local spatial adaptation and realistic appearance learning, utilizing a hybrid Tetrahedron-constrained Gaussian Splatting (TetGS) as the underlying representation. TetGS combines the controllable explicit structure of tetrahedral grids with the high-precision rendering capabilities of 3D Gaussian Splatting and is optimized in a progressive manner comprising three stages: 3D avatar instantiation from real-world monocular videos to provide accurate priors for TetGS initialization; localized spatial adaptation with explicitly partitioned tetrahedrons to guide the redistribution of Gaussian kernels; and geometry-based appearance generation with a coarse-to-fine activation strategy. Both qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our approach in generating photorealistic 3D editable avatars.</p></details>|[2504.20403](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20403)|null|

First, the method uses 3DGS to render a synthetic RGBD image at some initial pose estimate. Second, it establishes 2D-2D correspondences between the query image and this synthetic image. Third, it uses the depth map to lift the 2D-2D correspondences to 2D-3D correspondences and solves a perspective-n-point (PnP) problem to produce a final pose estimate. Results from evaluation across three existing datasets with 38 scenes and over 2,700 test images show that our method significantly reduces both inference time (by over two orders of magnitude, from more than 10 seconds to as fast as 0.1 seconds) and estimation error compared to baseline methods that use photometric loss minimization. Results also show that our method tolerates large errors in the initial pose estimate of up to 55{\deg} in rotation and 1.1 units in translation (normalized by scene scale), achieving final pose errors of less than 5{\deg} in rotation and 0.05 units in translation on 90% of images from the Synthetic NeRF and Mip-NeRF360 datasets and on 42% of images from the more challenging Tanks and Temples dataset.</p></details>|[2504.20379](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20379)|null|

Previous methods relying on dense views struggle with extremely sparse Structure-from-Motion points for initialization. While learning-based Multi-view Stereo (MVS) provides dense 3D points, directly combining it with Gaussian Splatting leads to suboptimal results due to the ill-posed nature of sparse-view geometric optimization. We propose Sparse2DGS, an MVS-initialized Gaussian Splatting pipeline for complete and accurate reconstruction. Our key insight is to incorporate the geometric-prioritized enhancement schemes, allowing for direct and robust geometric learning under ill-posed conditions. Sparse2DGS outperforms existing methods by notable margins while being ${2}\times$ faster than the NeRF-based fine-tuning approach.</p></details>|[2504.20378](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20378)|null|
|**2025-04-28**|**MP-SfM: Monocular Surface Priors for Robust Structure-from-Motion**|<details><summary>Show Abstract</summary><p>While Structure-from-Motion (SfM) has seen much progress over the years, state-of-the-art systems are prone to failure when facing extreme viewpoint changes in low-overlap, low-parallax or high-symmetry scenarios. Because capturing images that avoid these pitfalls is challenging, this severely limits the wider use of SfM, especially by non-expert users. We overcome these limitations by augmenting the classical SfM paradigm with monocular depth and normal priors inferred by deep neural networks. Thanks to a tight integration of monocular and multi-view constraints, our approach significantly outperforms existing ones under extreme viewpoint changes, while maintaining strong performance in standard conditions. We also show that monocular priors can help reject faulty associations due to symmetries, which is a long-standing problem for SfM. This makes our approach the first capable of reliably reconstructing challenging indoor environments from few images. Through principled uncertainty propagation, it is robust to errors in the priors, can handle priors inferred by different models with little tuning, and will thus easily benefit from future progress in monocular depth and normal estimation.

Our model builds upon the recent Large Reconstruction Models (LRMs) that achieve state-of-the-art sparse-view reconstruction quality. However, existing LRMs struggle to reconstruct unseen parts accurately and cannot recover glossy appearance or generate relightable 3D contents that can be consumed by standard Graphics engines. To address these limitations, we make three key technical contributions to build a more practical multi-view 3D reconstruction framework. First, we introduce an update model that allows us to progressively add more input views to improve our reconstruction. Second, we propose a hexa-plane neural SDF representation to better recover detailed textures, geometry and material parameters. Third, we develop a novel neural directional-embedding mechanism to handle view-dependent effects. Trained on a large-scale shape and material dataset with a tailored coarse-to-fine training scheme, our model achieves compelling results. It compares favorably to optimization-based dense-view inverse rendering methods in terms of geometry and relighting accuracy, while requiring only a fraction of the inference time.</p></details>|[2504.20026](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20026)|null|
|**2025-04-28**|**Mesh-Learner: Texturing Mesh with Spherical Harmonics**|<details><summary>Show Abstract</summary><p>In this paper, we present a 3D reconstruction and rendering framework termed Mesh-Learner that is natively compatible with traditional rasterization pipelines. It integrates mesh and spherical harmonic (SH) texture (i.e., texture filled with SH coefficients) into the learning process to learn each mesh s view-dependent radiance end-to-end. Images are rendered by interpolating surrounding SH Texels at each pixel s sampling point using a novel interpolation method. Conversely, gradients from each pixel are back-propagated to the related SH Texels in SH textures. Mesh-Learner exploits graphic features of rasterization pipeline (texture sampling, deferred rendering) to render, which makes Mesh-Learner naturally compatible with tools (e.g., Blender) and tasks (e.g., 3D reconstruction, scene rendering, reinforcement learning for robotics) that are based on rasterization pipelines. Our system can train vast, unlimited scenes because we transfer only the SH textures within the frustum to the GPU for training. At other times, the SH textures are stored in CPU RAM, which results in moderate GPU memory usage. The rendering results on interpolation and extrapolation sequences in the Replica and FAST-LIVO2 datasets achieve state-of-the-art performance compared to existing state-of-the-art methods (e.g., 3D Gaussian Splatting and M2-Mapping).

Traditional structured light techniques rely on inherent point-to-point triangulation, which limits accurate 3D measurements in these challenging scenarios. Parallel single-pixel imaging (PSI) has demonstrated unprecedented superiority under extreme conditions and has emerged as a promising approach of accurate 3D measurements. However, a complete theoretical model has not been reported in existing work to well explain its underlying mechanisms and quantitatively characterize its performance. In this study, a comprehensive theoretical model for the PSI method is proposed, including imaging and noise models. The proposed imaging model describes light transport coefficients under complex illumination, elucidating the intrinsic mechanisms of successful 3D imaging using PSI. The developed noise model quantitatively analyzes the impact of environmental noise on measurement accuracy, offering a framework to guide the error analysis of a PSI system. Numerical simulations and experimental results validate the proposed models, revealing the generality and robustness of PSI. Finally, potential research directions are highlighted to guide and inspire future investigations. The established theoretical models lay a solid foundation of PSI and brings new insights and opportunities for future application in more demanding 3D reconstruction tasks.</p></details>|[2504.19923](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19923)|null|

|**2025-04-24**|**CasualHDRSplat: Robust High Dynamic Range 3D Gaussian Splatting from Casually Captured Videos**|<details><summary>Show Abstract</summary><p>Recently, photo-realistic novel view synthesis from multi-view images, such as neural radiance field (NeRF) and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), have garnered widespread attention due to their superior performance. However, most works rely on low dynamic range (LDR) images, which limits the capturing of richer scene details. Some prior works have focused on high dynamic range (HDR) scene reconstruction, typically require capturing of multi-view sharp images with different exposure times at fixed camera positions during exposure times, which is time-consuming and challenging in practice. For a more flexible data acquisition, we propose a one-stage method: \textbf{CasualHDRSplat} to easily and robustly reconstruct the 3D HDR scene from casually captured videos with auto-exposure enabled, even in the presence of severe motion blur and varying unknown exposure time. \textbf{CasualHDRSplat} contains a unified differentiable physical imaging model which first applies continuous-time trajectory constraint to imaging process so that we can jointly optimize exposure time, camera response function (CRF), camera poses, and sharp 3D HDR scene. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing methods in terms of robustness and rendering quality.

While deep learning approaches have significantly improved performance, they often incur substantial computational costs, limiting their deployment in real-time edge applications. Efforts to create lightweight neural networks have seen some success, yet they often result in trade-offs between efficiency and accuracy. Additionally, the high-dimensional descriptors generated by these networks poses challenges for distributed applications requiring efficient communication and coordination, highlighting the need for compact yet competitively accurate descriptors. In this paper, we present EdgePoint2, a series of lightweight keypoint detection and description neural networks specifically tailored for edge computing applications on embedded system. The network architecture is optimized for efficiency without sacrificing accuracy. To train compact descriptors, we introduce a combination of Orthogonal Procrustes loss and similarity loss, which can serve as a general approach for hypersphere embedding distillation tasks. Additionally, we offer 14 sub-models to satisfy diverse application requirements. Our experiments demonstrate that EdgePoint2 consistently achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) accuracy and efficiency across various challenging scenarios while employing lower-dimensional descriptors (32/48/64). Beyond its accuracy, EdgePoint2 offers significant advantages in flexibility, robustness, and versatility. Consequently, EdgePoint2 emerges as a highly competitive option for visual tasks, especially in contexts demanding adaptability to diverse computational and communication constraints.</p></details>|[2504.17280](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17280)|null|

We focus on 2D range images~(RIs) as a lightweight format for representing 3D LiDAR observations. Although conventional image compression techniques can be adapted to improve compression efficiency for RIs, their practical performance is expected to be limited due to differences in bit precision and the distinct pixel value distribution characteristics between natural images and RIs. We propose a novel implicit neural representation~(INR)--based RI compression method that effectively handles floating-point valued pixels. The proposed method divides RIs into depth and mask images and compresses them using patch-wise and pixel-wise INR architectures with model pruning and quantization, respectively. Experiments on the KITTI dataset show that the proposed method outperforms existing image, point cloud, RI, and INR-based compression methods in terms of 3D reconstruction and detection quality at low bitrates and decoding latency.</p></details>|[2504.17229](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17229)|null|

We utilize recent advancements in 3D reconstruction based on Gaussian Splatting for 3D object placement in driving scenes. Unlike existing diffusion-based methods that synthesize images conditioned on BEV layouts, our approach places 3D objects directly in the reconstructed 3D space with explicitly imposed geometric transformations. This ensures both the physical plausibility of object placement and highly accurate 3D pose and position annotations.   Our experiments demonstrate that even by integrating a limited number of external 3D objects into real scenes, the augmented data significantly enhances 3D object detection performance and outperforms existing diffusion-based 3D augmentation for object detection. Extensive testing on the nuScenes dataset reveals that imposing high geometric diversity in object placement has a greater impact compared to the appearance diversity of objects. Additionally, we show that generating hard examples, either by maximizing detection loss or imposing high visual occlusion in camera images, does not lead to more efficient 3D data augmentation for camera-based 3D object detection in autonomous driving.</p></details>|[2504.16740](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16740)|null|

To achieve robust policy learning and generalization, we opt to learn a world model of the 3D rigid body dynamics involved in non-prehensile manipulations and use it for model-based reinforcement learning. We propose PIN-WM, a Physics-INformed World Model that enables efficient end-to-end identification of a 3D rigid body dynamical system from visual observations. Adopting differentiable physics simulation, PIN-WM can be learned with only few-shot and task-agnostic physical interaction trajectories. Further, PIN-WM is learned with observational loss induced by Gaussian Splatting without needing state estimation. To bridge Sim2Real gaps, we turn the learned PIN-WM into a group of Digital Cousins via physics-aware randomizations which perturb physics and rendering parameters to generate diverse and meaningful variations of the PIN-WM. Extensive evaluations on both simulation and real-world tests demonstrate that PIN-WM, enhanced with physics-aware digital cousins, facilitates learning robust non-prehensile manipulation skills with Sim2Real transfer, surpassing the Real2Sim2Real state-of-the-arts.</p></details>|[2504.16693](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16693)|null|

Without refocusing, the camera will automatically focus on the fixed object for all views, and current NeRF methods typically using one camera fail due to the consistent defocus blur and a lack of sharp reference. To restore the all-in-focus NeRF, we introduce the dual-camera from smartphones, where the ultra-wide camera has a wider depth-of-field (DoF) and the main camera possesses a higher resolution. The dual camera pair saves the high-fidelity details from the main camera and uses the ultra-wide camera's deep DoF as reference for all-in-focus restoration. To this end, we first implement spatial warping and color matching to align the dual camera, followed by a defocus-aware fusion module with learnable defocus parameters to predict a defocus map and fuse the aligned camera pair. We also build a multi-view dataset that includes image pairs of the main and ultra-wide cameras in a smartphone. Extensive experiments on this dataset verify that our solution, termed DC-NeRF, can produce high-quality all-in-focus novel views and compares favorably against strong baselines quantitatively and qualitatively. We further show DoF applications of DC-NeRF with adjustable blur intensity and focal plane, including refocusing and split diopter.</p></details>|[2504.16636](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16636)|null|

Our method integrates instance segmentation with generative inpainting to remove identifiable entities while preserving scene integrity. Extensive evaluations on 2D COCO-based object detection show that ROAR achieves 87.5% of the baseline detection average precision (AP), whereas image dropping achieves only 74.2% of the baseline AP, highlighting the advantage of scrubbing in preserving dataset utility. The degradation is even more severe for small objects due to occlusion and loss of fine-grained details.

Existing approaches address these issues by augmenting image observations in RGB space or employing Real-to-Sim-to-Real pipelines based on physical simulators. However, the former is constrained to 2D data augmentation, while the latter suffers from imprecise physical simulation caused by inaccurate geometric reconstruction. This paper introduces RoboSplat, a novel method that generates diverse, visually realistic demonstrations by directly manipulating 3D Gaussians. Specifically, we reconstruct the scene through 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), directly edit the reconstructed scene, and augment data across six types of generalization with five techniques: 3D Gaussian replacement for varying object types, scene appearance, and robot embodiments; equivariant transformations for different object poses; visual attribute editing for various lighting conditions; novel view synthesis for new camera perspectives; and 3D content generation for diverse object types. Comprehensive real-world experiments demonstrate that RoboSplat significantly enhances the generalization of visuomotor policies under diverse disturbances. Notably, while policies trained on hundreds of real-world demonstrations with additional 2D data augmentation achieve an average success rate of 57.2%, RoboSplat attains 87.8% in one-shot settings across six types of generalization in the real world.</p></details>|[2504.13175](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13175)|null|

While recent advances in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have enabled fast and high-quality scene reconstruction, research has also explored incorporating open-vocabulary understanding into 3DGS. However, most existing methods require iterative optimization over per-view 2D semantic feature maps, which not only results in inefficiencies but also leads to inconsistent 3D semantics across views. To address these limitations, we introduce a training-free framework that constructs a superpoint graph directly from Gaussian primitives. The superpoint graph partitions the scene into spatially compact and semantically coherent regions, forming view-consistent 3D entities and providing a structured foundation for open-vocabulary understanding. Based on the graph structure, we design an efficient reprojection strategy that lifts 2D semantic features onto the superpoints, avoiding costly multi-view iterative training. The resulting representation ensures strong 3D semantic coherence and naturally supports hierarchical understanding, enabling both coarse- and fine-grained open-vocabulary perception within a unified semantic field. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art open-vocabulary segmentation performance, with semantic field reconstruction completed over $30\times$ faster.

This is achieved by predicting two appropriately defined pointmaps for a pair of frames captured at different moments. Specifically, we predict both pointmaps at the same moment, in the same world, capturing both static and dynamic scene geometry while maintaining 3D correspondences. Chaining these predictions through the video sequence with respect to a reference frame naturally computes long-range correspondences, effectively combining 3D reconstruction with 3D tracking. Unlike prior methods that rely heavily on 4D ground truth supervision, we employ a novel adaptation scheme based on a reprojection loss. We establish a new extensive benchmark for world-frame reconstruction and tracking, demonstrating the effectiveness and efficiency of our unified, data-driven framework. Our code, model, and benchmark will be released.</p></details>|[2504.13152](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13152)|null|
|**2025-04-17**|**CompGS++: Compressed Gaussian Splatting for Static and Dynamic Scene Representation**|<details><summary>Show Abstract</summary><p>Gaussian splatting demonstrates proficiency for 3D scene modeling but suffers from substantial data volume due to inherent primitive redundancy. To enable future photorealistic 3D immersive visual communication applications, significant compression is essential for transmission over the existing Internet infrastructure. Hence, we propose Compressed Gaussian Splatting (CompGS++), a novel framework that leverages compact Gaussian primitives to achieve accurate 3D modeling with substantial size reduction for both static and dynamic scenes. Our design is based on the principle of eliminating redundancy both between and within primitives. Specifically, we develop a comprehensive prediction paradigm to address inter-primitive redundancy through spatial and temporal primitive prediction modules. The spatial primitive prediction module establishes predictive relationships for scene primitives and enables most primitives to be encoded as compact residuals, substantially reducing the spatial redundancy. We further devise a temporal primitive prediction module to handle dynamic scenes, which exploits primitive correlations across timestamps to effectively reduce temporal redundancy. Moreover, we devise a rate-constrained optimization module that jointly minimizes reconstruction error and rate consumption. This module effectively eliminates parameter redundancy within primitives and enhances the overall compactness of scene representations. Comprehensive evaluations across multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that CompGS++ significantly outperforms existing methods, achieving superior compression performance while preserving accurate scene modeling. Our implementation will be made publicly available on GitHub to facilitate further research.</p></details>|[2504.13022](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13022)|null|

These avatars bridge the gap between the physical and digital worlds, improving the user experience through realistic human representation. However, existing avatar creation techniques face significant challenges, including high costs, long creation times, and limited utility in virtual applications. Manual methods, such as MetaHuman, require extensive time and expertise, while automatic approaches, such as NeRF-based pipelines often lack efficiency, detailed facial expression fidelity, and are unable to be rendered at a speed sufficent for real-time applications. By involving several cutting-edge modern techniques, we introduce an end-to-end 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) avatar creation pipeline that leverages monocular video input to create a scalable and efficient photorealistic avatar directly compatible with the Unity game engine. Our pipeline incorporates a novel Gaussian splatting technique with customized preprocessing that enables the user of "in the wild" monocular video capture, detailed facial expression reconstruction and embedding within a fully rigged avatar model. Additionally, we present a Unity-integrated Gaussian Splatting Avatar Editor, offering a user-friendly environment for VR/AR application development. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of our preprocessing pipeline in standardizing custom data for 3DGS training and demonstrate the versatility of Gaussian avatars in Unity, highlighting the scalability and practicality of our approach.</p></details>|[2504.12999](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12999)|null|
|**2025-04-17**|**Second-order Optimization of Gaussian Splats with Importance Sampling**|<details><summary>Show Abstract</summary><p>3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) is widely used for novel view synthesis due to its high rendering quality and fast inference time. However, 3DGS predominantly relies on first-order optimizers such as Adam, which leads to long training times. To address this limitation, we propose a novel second-order optimization strategy based on Levenberg-Marquardt (LM) and Conjugate Gradient (CG), which we specifically tailor towards Gaussian Splatting. Our key insight is that the Jacobian in 3DGS exhibits significant sparsity since each Gaussian affects only a limited number of pixels. We exploit this sparsity by proposing a matrix-free and GPU-parallelized LM optimization. To further improve its efficiency, we propose sampling strategies for both the camera views and loss function and, consequently, the normal equation, significantly reducing the computational complexity. In addition, we increase the convergence rate of the second-order approximation by introducing an effective heuristic to determine the learning rate that avoids the expensive computation cost of line search methods. As a result, our method achieves a $3\times$ speedup over standard LM and outperforms Adam by $~6\times$ when the Gaussian count is low while remaining competitive for moderate counts.

We argue that incorporating full 3D evaluation of Gaussians throughout the 3DGS pipeline can effectively address these issues while preserving rasterization efficiency. Specifically, we introduce an adaptive 3D smoothing filter to mitigate aliasing and present a stable view-space bounding method that eliminates popping artifacts when Gaussians extend beyond the view frustum. Furthermore, we promote tile-based culling to 3D with screen-space planes, accelerating rendering and reducing sorting costs for hierarchical rasterization. Our method achieves state-of-the-art quality on in-distribution evaluation sets and significantly outperforms other approaches for out-of-distribution views. Our qualitative evaluations further demonstrate the effective removal of aliasing, distortions, and popping artifacts, ensuring real-time, artifact-free rendering.</p></details>|[2504.12811](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12811)|null|

We introduce CAGE-GS, a cage-based 3DGS deformation method that seamlessly aligns a source 3DGS scene with a user-defined target shape. Our approach learns a deformation cage from the target, which guides the geometric transformation of the source scene. While the cages effectively control structural alignment, preserving the textural appearance of 3DGS remains challenging due to the complexity of covariance parameters. To address this, we employ a Jacobian matrix-based strategy to update the covariance parameters of each Gaussian, ensuring texture fidelity post-deformation. Our method is highly flexible, accommodating various target shape representations, including texts, images, point clouds, meshes and 3DGS models. Extensive experiments and ablation studies on both public datasets and newly proposed scenes demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing techniques in both efficiency and deformation quality.</p></details>|[2504.12800](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12800)|null|
|**2025-04-14**|**DNF-Avatar: Distilling Neural Fields for Real-time Animatable Avatar Relighting**|<details><summary>Show Abstract</summary><p>Creating relightable and animatable human avatars from monocular videos is a rising research topic with a range of applications, e.g. virtual reality, sports, and video games. Previous works utilize neural fields together with physically based rendering (PBR), to estimate geometry and disentangle appearance properties of human avatars. However, one drawback of these methods is the slow rendering speed due to the expensive Monte Carlo ray tracing. To tackle this problem, we proposed to distill the knowledge from implicit neural fields (teacher) to explicit 2D Gaussian splatting (student) representation to take advantage of the fast rasterization property of Gaussian splatting. To avoid ray-tracing, we employ the split-sum approximation for PBR appearance. We also propose novel part-wise ambient occlusion probes for shadow computation. Shadow prediction is achieved by querying these probes only once per pixel, which paves the way for real-time relighting of avatars. These techniques combined give high-quality relighting results with realistic shadow effects. Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed student model achieves comparable or even better relighting results with our teacher model while being 370 times faster at inference time, achieving a 67 FPS rendering speed.</p></details>|[2504.10486](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10486)|null|

While recent NeRF-based approaches have shown promising results, most suffer from high computational costs, and some rely on carefully captured or pre-processed data--such as RAW sensor inputs or multi-exposure sequences--which severely limits their practicality. In contrast, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) enables real-time rendering with competitive visual fidelity; however, existing 3DGS-based methods struggle with low-light sRGB inputs, resulting in unstable Gaussian initialization and ineffective noise suppression. To address these challenges, we propose LL-Gaussian, a novel framework for 3D reconstruction and enhancement from low-light sRGB images, enabling pseudo normal-light novel view synthesis. Our method introduces three key innovations: 1) an end-to-end Low-Light Gaussian Initialization Module (LLGIM) that leverages dense priors from learning-based MVS approach to generate high-quality initial point clouds; 2) a dual-branch Gaussian decomposition model that disentangles intrinsic scene properties (reflectance and illumination) from transient interference, enabling stable and interpretable optimization; 3) an unsupervised optimization strategy guided by both physical constrains and diffusion prior to jointly steer decomposition and enhancement. Additionally, we contribute a challenging dataset collected in extreme low-light environments and demonstrate the effectiveness of LL-Gaussian. Compared to state-of-the-art NeRF-based methods, LL-Gaussian achieves up to 2,000 times faster inference and reduces training time to just 2%, while delivering superior reconstruction and rendering quality.</p></details>|[2504.10331](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10331)|null|

However, several challenges remain. In practical applications, users often provide extremely simple text inputs while expecting high-quality 3D content. Generating optimal results from such minimal text is a difficult task due to the strong dependency of text-to-3D models on the quality of input prompts. Moreover, the generation process exhibits high variability, making it difficult to control. Consequently, multiple iterations are typically required to produce content that meets user expectations, reducing generation efficiency. To address this issue, we propose GPT-4V for self-optimization, which significantly enhances the efficiency of generating satisfactory content in a single attempt. Furthermore, the controllability of text-to-3D generation methods has not been fully explored. Our approach enables users to not only provide textual descriptions but also specify additional conditions, such as style, edges, scribbles, poses, or combinations of multiple conditions, allowing for more precise control over the generated 3D content. Additionally, during training, we effectively integrate multi-view information, including multi-view depth, masks, features, and images, to address the common Janus problem in 3D content generation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves robust generalization, facilitating the efficient and controllable generation of high-quality 3D content.</p></details>|[2504.10316](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10316)|null|

Advancements in neural networks have significantly alleviated this burden, enabling highly accurate ball tracking in sports broadcasts. However, relying solely on 2D ball tracking is limiting, as it depends on the camera's viewpoint and falls short of supporting comprehensive game analysis. To address this limitation, we propose a novel approach for reconstructing precise 3D ball trajectories from online table tennis match recordings. Our method leverages the underlying physics of the ball's motion to identify the bounce state that minimizes the reprojection error of the ball's flying trajectory, hence ensuring an accurate and reliable 3D reconstruction. A key advantage of our approach is its ability to infer ball spin without relying on human pose estimation or racket tracking, which are often unreliable or unavailable in broadcast footage. We developed an automated camera calibration method capable of reliably tracking camera movements. Additionally, we adapted an existing 3D pose estimation model, which lacks depth motion capture, to accurately track player movements. Together, these contributions enable the full 3D reconstruction of a table tennis rally.</p></details>|[2504.10035](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10035)|null|

In scenarios with rapid motion or low-light conditions, existing RGB-based deblurring methods struggle to model camera pose and radiance changes during exposure, reducing reconstruction accuracy. Event cameras, capturing continuous brightness changes during exposure, can effectively assist in modeling motion blur and improving reconstruction quality. Therefore, we propose Event-driven Bundle Adjusted Deblur Gaussian Splatting (EBAD-Gaussian), which reconstructs sharp 3D Gaussians from event streams and severely blurred images. This method jointly learns the parameters of these Gaussians while recovering camera motion trajectories during exposure time. Specifically, we first construct a blur loss function by synthesizing multiple latent sharp images during the exposure time, minimizing the difference between real and synthesized blurred images. Then we use event stream to supervise the light intensity changes between latent sharp images at any time within the exposure period, supplementing the light intensity dynamic changes lost in RGB images. Furthermore, we optimize the latent sharp images at intermediate exposure times based on the event-based double integral (EDI) prior, applying consistency constraints to enhance the details and texture information of the reconstructed images. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets show that EBAD-Gaussian can achieve high-quality 3D scene reconstruction under the condition of blurred images and event stream inputs.</p></details>|[2504.10012](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10012)|null|

Recent advances have explored two promising directions: multiview generative models that train on 3D consistent datasets but struggle with out-of-distribution generalization, and 3D scene inpainting and completion frameworks that suffer from cross-view inconsistency and suboptimal error handling, as they depend exclusively on depth data or 3D smoothness, which ultimately degrades output quality and computational performance. Building upon these approaches, we present GaussVideoDreamer, which advances generative multimedia approaches by bridging the gap between image, video, and 3D generation, integrating their strengths through two key innovations: (1) A progressive video inpainting strategy that harnesses temporal coherence for improved multiview consistency and faster convergence. (2) A 3D Gaussian Splatting consistency mask to guide the video diffusion with 3D consistent multiview evidence. Our pipeline combines three core components: a geometry-aware initialization protocol, Inconsistency-Aware Gaussian Splatting, and a progressive video inpainting strategy.

However, even the state-of-the-art NeRF model, Gaussian Splatting, requires minutes for training, far from the real-time performance required by multimedia scenarios like telemedicine. One of the obstacles is its inefficient sampling, which is only partially addressed by existing works. Existing point-sampling algorithms uniformly sample simple-texture regions (easy to fit) and complex-texture regions (hard to fit), while existing ray-sampling algorithms sample these regions all in the finest granularity (i.e. the pixel level), both wasting GPU training resources. Actually, regions with different texture intensities require different sampling granularities. To this end, we propose a novel dynamic-resolution ray-sampling algorithm, MCBlock, which employs Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to partition each training image into pixel blocks with different sizes for active block-wise training. Specifically, the trees are initialized according to the texture of training images to boost the initialization speed, and an expansion/pruning module dynamically optimizes the block partition. MCBlock is implemented in Nerfstudio, an open-source toolset, and achieves a training acceleration of up to 2.33x, surpassing other ray-sampling algorithms. We believe MCBlock can apply to any cone-tracing NeRF model and contribute to the multimedia community.</p></details>|[2504.09878](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09878)|null|

However, while many methods focus on geometric consistency, they often neglect the potential of text-driven guidance to enhance semantic understanding, which is crucial for accurately reconstructing fine-grained details in complex scenes. To address this limitation, we propose TextSplat--the first text-driven Generalizable Gaussian Splatting framework. By employing a text-guided fusion of diverse semantic cues, our framework learns robust cross-modal feature representations that improve the alignment of geometric and semantic information, producing high-fidelity 3D reconstructions. Specifically, our framework employs three parallel modules to obtain complementary representations: the Diffusion Prior Depth Estimator for accurate depth information, the Semantic Aware Segmentation Network for detailed semantic information, and the Multi-View Interaction Network for refined cross-view features. Then, in the Text-Guided Semantic Fusion Module, these representations are integrated via the text-guided and attention-based feature aggregation mechanism, resulting in enhanced 3D Gaussian parameters enriched with detailed semantic cues. Experimental results on various benchmark datasets demonstrate improved performance compared to existing methods across multiple evaluation metrics, validating the effectiveness of our framework.

While state-of-the-art methods rely on tailored and/or high-end equipment for data acquisition, which can be cumbersome and time-consuming, this work introduces a scalable polarization-aided approach that employs cost-effective acquisition tools. By attaching a linear polarizer to readily available RGB cameras, multi-view polarization images can be captured without the need for advance calibration or precise measurements of the polarizer angle, substantially reducing system construction costs. The proposed approach represents polarimetric BRDF, Stokes vectors, and polarization states of object surfaces as neural implicit fields. These fields, combined with the polarizer angle, are retrieved by optimizing the rendering loss of input polarized images. By leveraging fundamental physical principles for the implicit representation of polarization rendering, our method demonstrates superiority over existing techniques through experiments in public datasets and real captured images on both reconstruction and novel view synthesis.</p></details>|[2504.07025](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07025)|null|

Solutions based on multi-view RGB images are attractive due to their scalability and affordability, enabling volumetric measurements that 2D approaches cannot directly capture. While advanced methods like Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) have shown promise, their application has been limited to counting or extracting traits from only a few plants or organs. Furthermore, accurately measuring complex structures like individual wheat heads-essential for studying crop yields-remains particularly challenging due to occlusions and the dense arrangement of crop canopies in field conditions. The recent development of 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) offers a promising alternative for HTFP due to its high-quality reconstructions and explicit point-based representation. In this paper, we present Wheat3DGS, a novel approach that leverages 3DGS and the Segment Anything Model (SAM) for precise 3D instance segmentation and morphological measurement of hundreds of wheat heads automatically, representing the first application of 3DGS to HTFP.

Methods apply it to relighting by separating radiance into BRDF parameters and lighting, yet produce inferior relighting quality with artifacts and unnatural indirect illumination due to the limited capability of each Gaussian, which has constant material parameters and normal, alongside the absence of physical constraints for indirect lighting. In this paper, we present a novel framework called Spatially-vayring Gaussian Inverse Rendering (SVG-IR), aimed at enhancing both NVS and relighting quality. To this end, we propose a new representation-Spatially-varying Gaussian (SVG)-that allows per-Gaussian spatially varying parameters. This enhanced representation is complemented by a SVG splatting scheme akin to vertex/fragment shading in traditional graphics pipelines. Furthermore, we integrate a physically-based indirect lighting model, enabling more realistic relighting. The proposed SVG-IR framework significantly improves rendering quality, outperforming state-of-the-art NeRF-based methods by 2.5 dB in peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) and surpassing existing Gaussian-based techniques by 3.5 dB in relighting tasks, all while maintaining a real-time rendering speed.</p></details>|[2504.06815](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06815)|null|

Our simulations reproduce observed $M_{\rm star}$-SFR relations and $\delta$ at these redshifts. We find: (1) protocluster (PC) and mean-density field (MF) galaxies show similar $M_{\rm star}$-SFR relations, with PC galaxies extending to higher $M_{\rm star}$ and SFR. (2) UV-bright PC galaxies ($M_{\rm UV}\lesssim -20$~mag) have $>2$ mag higher UV attenuation and shallower UV slopes than MF galaxies. (3) $\delta$ increases with redshift, depending on observational parameters (e.g., $\delta\sim50$ at $z=14$ to $\delta\sim3$ at $z=6$ for a search volume of $\sim3000$~cMpc$^3$ and a limiting magnitude of $M_{\rm UV}=-17$~mag). These results indicate that enhanced star formation in PCs is driven by massive galaxy overdensity, not anomalously high specific SFR. While simulated $\delta$ agrees with observed PC candidates (potential Coma progenitors), some MF galaxies show comparable $\delta$. We propose a robust PC identification method using both $\delta$ and $M_{\rm star}$ of the most massive member. Critical $M_{\rm star}$ thresholds for Coma progenitors are estimated ($10^{7.1}$ to $10^{10.2}$ M$_\odot$ from $z=14$ to 6).

However, it suffers from large storage and memory requirements, and its training speed still lags behind the hash-grid based radiance field approaches (e.g. Instant-NGP), which makes it especially difficult to deploy them in robotics scenarios, where 3D reconstruction is crucial for accurate operation. In this paper, we propose GSta that dynamically identifies Gaussians that have converged well during training, based on their positional and color gradient norms. By forcing such Gaussians into a siesta and stopping their updates (freezing) during training, we improve training speed with competitive accuracy compared to state of the art. We also propose an early stopping mechanism based on the PSNR values computed on a subset of training images. Combined with other improvements, such as integrating a learning rate scheduler, GSta achieves an improved Pareto front in convergence speed, memory and storage requirements, while preserving quality. We also show that GSta can improve other methods and complement orthogonal approaches in efficiency improvement; once combined with Trick-GS, GSta achieves up to 5x faster training, 16x smaller disk size compared to vanilla GS, while having comparable accuracy and consuming only half the peak memory.

In this work, we consider the question of collision avoidance from an implicit environment model. We use monocular RGB images as inputs and train a collisionavoidance policy from photorealistic images generated by 2D Gaussian splatting. We evaluate the resulting pipeline in realworld experiments under velocity commands that bring the robot on an intercept course with obstacles. Our results suggest that RGB images can be enough to make collision-avoidance decisions, both in the room where training data was collected and in out-of-distribution environments.</p></details>|[2504.06651](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06651)|null|
|**2025-04-09**|**Stochastic Ray Tracing of 3D Transparent Gaussians**|<details><summary>Show Abstract</summary><p>3D Gaussian splatting has recently been widely adopted as a 3D representation for novel-view synthesis, relighting, and text-to-3D generation tasks, offering realistic and detailed results through a collection of explicit 3D Gaussians carrying opacities and view-dependent colors. However, efficient rendering of many transparent primitives remains a significant challenge. Existing approaches either rasterize the 3D Gaussians with approximate sorting per view or rely on high-end RTX GPUs to exhaustively process all ray-Gaussian intersections (bounding Gaussians by meshes). This paper proposes a stochastic ray tracing method to render 3D clouds of transparent primitives. Instead of processing all ray-Gaussian intersections in sequential order, each ray traverses the acceleration structure only once, randomly accepting and shading a single intersection (or N intersections, using a simple extension). This approach minimizes shading time and avoids sorting the Gaussians along the ray while minimizing the register usage and maximizing parallelism even on low-end GPUs. The cost of rays through the Gaussian asset is comparable to that of standard mesh-intersection rays. While our method introduces noise, the shading is unbiased, and the variance is slight, as stochastic acceptance is importance-sampled based on accumulated opacity. The alignment with the Monte Carlo philosophy simplifies implementation and easily integrates our method into a conventional path-tracing framework.</p></details>|[2504.06598](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06598)|null|

Though several resources exist to obtain this information, they often lack the required temporal resolution for short-term monitoring (e.g., every hour). To address this issue, this study implements a low-cost ZED 2i stereo camera system and close-range photogrammetry to collect images for generating 3D point clouds, digital surface models (DSMs) of beach elevation, and georectified imagery at a localized scale and high temporal resolution. The main contributions of this study are (i) intrinsic camera calibration, (ii) georectification and registration of acquired imagery and point cloud, (iii) generation of the DSM of the beach elevation, and (iv) a comparison of derived products against those from uncrewed aircraft system structure-from-motion photogrammetry. Preliminary results show that despite its limitations, the ZED 2i can provide the desired mapping products at localized and high temporal scales. The system achieved a mean reprojection error of 0.20 px, a point cloud registration of 27 cm, a vertical error of 37.56 cm relative to ground truth, and georectification root mean square errors of 2.67 cm and 2.81 cm for x and y.</p></details>|[2504.06464](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06464)|null|
|**2025-04-03**|**Adaptive Frequency Enhancement Network for Remote Sensing Image Semantic Segmentation**|<details><summary>Show Abstract</summary><p>Semantic segmentation of high-resolution remote sensing images plays a crucial role in land-use monitoring and urban planning. Recent remarkable progress in deep learning-based methods makes it possible to generate satisfactory segmentation results. However, existing methods still face challenges in adapting network parameters to various land cover distributions and enhancing the interaction between spatial and frequency domain features. To address these challenges, we propose the Adaptive Frequency Enhancement Network (AFENet), which integrates two key components: the Adaptive Frequency and Spatial feature Interaction Module (AFSIM) and the Selective feature Fusion Module (SFM). AFSIM dynamically separates and modulates high- and low-frequency features according to the content of the input image. It adaptively generates two masks to separate high- and low-frequency components, therefore providing optimal details and contextual supplementary information for ground object feature representation. SFM selectively fuses global context and local detailed features to enhance the network's representation capability. Hence, the interactions between frequency and spatial features are further enhanced. Extensive experiments on three publicly available datasets demonstrate that the proposed AFENet outperforms state-of-the-art methods. In addition, we also validate the effectiveness of AFSIM and SFM in managing diverse land cover types and complex scenarios. Our codes are available at https://github.com/oucailab/AFENet.</p></details>|[2504.02647](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02647)|**[link](https://github.com/oucailab/AFENet.)**|

Our approach extends the TensoRF NeRF model by incorporating a dedicated watermark grid alongside the existing geometry and appearance grids. This extension ensures higher watermark capacity without entangling watermark signals with scene content. We propose a FiLM-based conditional modulation mechanism that dynamically activates watermarks based on input identifiers, allowing multiple independent watermarks to be embedded and extracted without requiring model retraining. MultiNeRF is validated on the NeRF-Synthetic and LLFF datasets, with statistically significant improvements in robust capacity without compromising rendering quality.

While previous 3D Gaussian Splatting (GS)-based methods largely depended on depth sensors, our approach reduces the hardware dependency and only requires RGB input, leveraging online visual odometry (VO) to generate sparse point clouds in real-time. To reduce redundancy and enhance the quality of 3D scene reconstruction, we implemented a series of methodological enhancements in 3D Gaussian mapping. Firstly, we introduced dynamic 3D Gaussian insertion to avoid adding redundant Gaussians in previously well-reconstructed areas. Secondly, we introduced clarity-enhancing Gaussian densification module and planar regularization to handle texture-less areas and flat surfaces better. We achieved precise camera tracking results both on the synthetic Replica and real-world TUM-RGBD datasets, comparable to those of the state-of-the-art.

The success of NeRF-based generative methods indicates a promising direction to address this challenge. However, unlike their success at the object level, existing scene-level generative methods require additional information, such as multiple views, depth images, or semantic guidance, rather than relying solely on RGB images. This is because NeRF-based methods necessitate prior knowledge of camera poses, which is challenging to approximate for indoor scenes due to the complexity of defining alignment and the difficulty of globally estimating poses from a single image, given the unseen parts behind the camera. To address this challenge, we redefine global poses within the framework of Local-Pose-Alignment (LPA) -- an anchor-based multi-local-coordinate system that uses a selected number of anchors as the roots of these coordinates. Building on this foundation, we introduce LPA-GAN, a novel NeRF-based generative approach that incorporates specific modifications to estimate the priors of camera poses under LPA. It also co-optimizes the pose predictor and scene generation processes. Our ablation study and comparisons with straightforward extensions of NeRF-based object generative methods demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. Furthermore, visual comparisons with other techniques reveal that our method achieves superior view-to-view consistency and semantic normality.</p></details>|[2504.02337](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02337)|null|

While state-of-the-art methods leverage 3D Gaussian Splatting with score distillation to enhance multi-view rendering through pre-trained text-to-image (T2I) models, they suffer from inherent view biases in T2I priors. These biases lead to inconsistent 3D generation, particularly manifesting as the multi-face Janus problem, where objects exhibit conflicting features across views. To address this fundamental challenge, we propose ConsDreamer, a novel framework that mitigates view bias by refining both the conditional and unconditional terms in the score distillation process: (1) a View Disentanglement Module (VDM) that eliminates viewpoint biases in conditional prompts by decoupling irrelevant view components and injecting precise camera parameters; and (2) a similarity-based partial order loss that enforces geometric consistency in the unconditional term by aligning cosine similarities with azimuth relationships. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ConsDreamer effectively mitigates the multi-face Janus problem in text-to-3D generation, outperforming existing methods in both visual quality and consistency.</p></details>|[2504.02316](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02316)|null|

We propose a digital-twin imaging method based on Gaussian splatting to observe an object behind a scattering medium. A digital twin model built through data assimilation, emulates the behavior of objects and environmental changes in a virtual space. By constructing a digital twin using point clouds composed of Gaussians and simulating the scattering process through the convolution of a point spread function, three-dimensional objects behind a scattering medium can be reproduced as a digital twin. In this study, a high-contrast digital twin reproducing a three-dimensional object was successfully constructed from degraded images, assuming that data were acquired from wavefronts disturbed by a scattering medium.

Specifically, our approach focuses on synthesizing foreground components, such as various human instances in motion within complex scene backgrounds, from UAV perspectives. This is achieved by integrating 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) for reconstructing backgrounds along with controllable synthetic human models that display diverse appearances and actions in multiple poses. To the best of our knowledge, UAVTwin is the first approach for UAV-based perception that is capable of generating high-fidelity digital twins based on 3DGS. The proposed work significantly enhances downstream models through data augmentation for real-world environments with multiple dynamic objects and significant appearance variations-both of which typically introduce artifacts in 3DGS-based modeling. To tackle these challenges, we propose a novel appearance modeling strategy and a mask refinement module to enhance the training of 3D Gaussian Splatting. We demonstrate the high quality of neural rendering by achieving a 1.23 dB improvement in PSNR compared to recent methods. Furthermore, we validate the effectiveness of data augmentation by showing a 2.5% to 13.7% improvement in mAP for the human detection task.</p></details>|[2504.02158](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02158)|null|
|**2025-04-02**|**A Chefs KISS -- Utilizing semantic information in both ICP and SLAM framework**|<details><summary>Show Abstract</summary><p>For utilizing autonomous vehicle in urban areas a reliable localization is needed. Especially when HD maps are used, a precise and repeatable method has to be chosen. Therefore accurate map generation but also re-localization against these maps is necessary. Due to best 3D reconstruction of the surrounding, LiDAR has become a reliable modality for localization. The latest LiDAR odometry estimation are based on iterative closest point (ICP) approaches, namely KISS-ICP and SAGE-ICP. We extend the capabilities of KISS-ICP by incorporating semantic information into the point alignment process using a generalizable approach with minimal parameter tuning. This enhancement allows us to surpass KISS-ICP in terms of absolute trajectory error (ATE), the primary metric for map accuracy. Additionally, we improve the Cartographer mapping framework to handle semantic information. Cartographer facilitates loop closure detection over larger areas, mitigating odometry drift and further enhancing ATE accuracy. By integrating semantic information into the mapping process, we enable the filtering of specific classes, such as parked vehicles, from the resulting map. This filtering improves relocalization quality by addressing temporal changes, such as vehicles being moved.</p></details>|[2504.02086](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02086)|null|

This study systematically evaluates key flight parameters-ground sampling distance (GSD) and image overlap-to optimize the 3D reconstruction of complex rooftop infrastructure. Controlled UAV flights were conducted over a multi-segment rooftop at Queen's University using a DJI Phantom 4 Pro V2, with varied GSD and overlap settings. The collected data were processed using Reality Capture software and evaluated against ground truth models generated from UAV-based LiDAR and terrestrial laser scanning (TLS). Experimental results indicate that a GSD range of 0.75-1.26 cm combined with 85% image overlap achieves a high degree of model accuracy, while minimizing images collected and flight time.

Our approach addresses two critical challenges: (1) precise 3D object extraction from the source scene, and (2) faithful relighting of the transferred object in the target scene without explicit material property estimation. TranSplat fits a splatting model to the source scene, using 2D object masks to drive fine-grained 3D segmentation. Following user-guided insertion of the object into the target scene, along with automatic refinement of position and orientation, TranSplat derives per-Gaussian radiance transfer functions via spherical harmonic analysis to adapt the object's appearance to match the target scene's lighting environment. This relighting strategy does not require explicitly estimating physical scene properties such as BRDFs. Evaluated on several synthetic and real-world scenes and objects, TranSplat yields excellent 3D object extractions and relighting performance compared to recent baseline methods and visually convincing cross-scene object transfers. We conclude by discussing the limitations of the approach.</p></details>|[2503.22676](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22676)|null|

In this paper, we present a novel approach that leverages an Audio Factorization Plane (Audio-Plane) based Gaussian Splatting for high-quality and real-time talking head generation. For modeling a dynamic talking head, 4D volume representation is needed. However, directly storing a dense 4D grid is impractical due to the high cost and lack of scalability for longer durations. We overcome this challenge with the proposed Audio-Plane, where the 4D volume representation is decomposed into audio-independent space planes and audio-dependent planes. This provides a compact and interpretable feature representation for talking head, facilitating more precise audio-aware spatial encoding and enhanced audio-driven lip dynamic modeling. To further improve speech dynamics, we develop a dynamic splatting method that helps the network more effectively focus on modeling the dynamics of the mouth region. Extensive experiments demonstrate that by integrating these innovations with the powerful Gaussian Splatting, our method is capable of synthesizing highly realistic talking videos in real time while ensuring precise audio-lip synchronization.

Although Scaffold-GS achieves higher quality real-time rendering compared to the original 3D-GS, its fine-grained rendering of the scene is extremely dependent on adequate viewing angles. The spectral bias of neural network learning results in Scaffold-GS's poor ability to perceive and learn high-frequency information in the scene. In this work, we propose enhancing the manifold complexity of input features and using network-based feature map loss to improve the image reconstruction quality of 3D-GS models. We introduce AH-GS, which enables 3D Gaussians in structurally complex regions to obtain higher-frequency encodings, allowing the model to more effectively learn the high-frequency information of the scene.

However, they often face challenges with temporal consistency, particularly in the talking head domain, where continuous changes in facial expressions intensify the level of difficulty. These issues stem from the independent editing of individual images and the inherent loss of temporal continuity during the editing process. In this paper, we introduce Follow Your Motion (FYM), a generic framework for maintaining temporal consistency in portrait editing. Specifically, given portrait images rendered by a pre-trained 3D Gaussian Splatting model, we first develop a diffusion model that intuitively and inherently learns motion trajectory changes at different scales and pixel coordinates, from the first frame to each subsequent frame. This approach ensures that temporally inconsistent edited avatars inherit the motion information from the rendered avatars. Secondly, to maintain fine-grained expression temporal consistency in talking head editing, we propose a dynamic re-weighted attention mechanism. This mechanism assigns higher weight coefficients to landmark points in space and dynamically updates these weights based on landmark loss, achieving more consistent and refined facial expressions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms existing approaches in terms of temporal consistency and can be used to optimize and compensate for temporally inconsistent outputs in a range of applications, such as text-driven editing, relighting, and various other applications.</p></details>|[2503.22225](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22225)|null|

To this end, a controllable matching stage is designed to achieve precise alignment between scene content and style features through segmentation masks. Moreover, a style transfer loss function based on feature alignment is proposed to ensure that the outcomes of style transfer accurately reflect the global style of the reference image. Furthermore, the original geometric information of the scene is preserved with the depth loss and Gaussian regularization terms.

However, most existing methods rely on 2D pixel-level parsing, leading to multi-view inconsistencies and poor 3D object retrieval. Moreover, they are limited to static scenes and struggle with dynamic scenes due to the complexities of motion modeling. In this paper, we propose Segment then Splat, a 3D-aware open vocabulary segmentation approach for both static and dynamic scenes based on Gaussian Splatting. Segment then Splat reverses the long established approach of "segmentation after reconstruction" by dividing Gaussians into distinct object sets before reconstruction. Once the reconstruction is complete, the scene is naturally segmented into individual objects, achieving true 3D segmentation. This approach not only eliminates Gaussian-object misalignment issues in dynamic scenes but also accelerates the optimization process, as it eliminates the need for learning a separate language field. After optimization, a CLIP embedding is assigned to each object to enable open-vocabulary querying. Extensive experiments on various datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method in both static and dynamic scenarios.</p></details>|[2503.22204](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22204)|null|

Recently, inspired by the remarkable success of NVS using 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), researchers have sought to extend 3D Gaussian models to four dimensions (4D) for dynamic novel-view synthesis. However, methods based on 4D rotation and scaling introduce spatiotemporal deformation into the 4D covariance matrix, necessitating the slicing of 4D Gaussians into 3D Gaussians. This process increases redundant computations as timestamps change-an inherent characteristic of dynamic scene rendering. Additionally, performing calculations on a four-dimensional matrix is computationally intensive. In this paper, we introduce Disentangled 4D Gaussian Splatting (Disentangled4DGS), a novel representation and rendering approach that disentangles temporal and spatial deformations, thereby eliminating the reliance on 4D matrix computations. We extend the 3DGS rendering process to 4D, enabling the projection of temporal and spatial deformations into dynamic 2D Gaussians in ray space. Consequently, our method facilitates faster dynamic scene synthesis. Moreover, it reduces storage requirements by at least 4.5\% due to our efficient presentation method. Our approach achieves an unprecedented average rendering speed of 343 FPS at a resolution of $1352\times1014$ on an RTX 3090 GPU, with experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrating its competitive performance in both monocular and multi-view scenarios.</p></details>|[2503.22159](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22159)|null|

Traditional NeRF-based reconstruction methods require cameras to move around stationary objects, but this approach is impractical for high-throughput environments where objects are rapidly imaged while moving on conveyors or rotating pedestals. To address this limitation, we develop a variant of NeRF-based PCD reconstruction that uses a single stationary camera to capture images as the object rotates on a pedestal. Our workflow comprises COLMAP-based pose estimation, a straightforward pose transformation to simulate camera movement, and subsequent standard NeRF training. A defined Region of Interest (ROI) excludes irrelevant scene data, enabling the generation of high-resolution point clouds (10M points). Experimental results demonstrate excellent reconstruction fidelity, with precision-recall analyses yielding an F-score close to 100.00 across all evaluated plant objects. Although pose estimation remains computationally intensive with a stationary camera setup, overall training and reconstruction times are competitive, validating the method's feasibility for practical high-throughput indoor phenotyping applications. Our findings indicate that high-quality NeRF-based 3D reconstructions are achievable using a stationary camera, eliminating the need for complex camera motion or costly imaging equipment. This approach is especially beneficial when employing expensive and delicate instruments, such as hyperspectral cameras, for 3D plant phenotyping. Future work will focus on optimizing pose estimation techniques and further streamlining the methodology to facilitate seamless integration into automated, high-throughput 3D phenotyping pipelines.</p></details>|[2503.21958](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21958)|null|

In this paper, we propose a two-phase head avatar reconstruction network that incorporates a refined 3D mesh representation. Our approach, in contrast to existing methods that rely on coarse template-based 3D representations derived from 3DMM, aims to learn a refined mesh representation suitable for a NeRF that captures complex facial nuances. In the first phase, we train 3DMM-stored NeRF with an initial mesh to utilize geometric priors and integrate observations across frames using a consistent set of latent codes. In the second phase, we leverage a novel mesh refinement procedure based on an SDF constructed from the density field of the initial NeRF. To mitigate the typical noise in the NeRF density field without compromising the features of the 3DMM, we employ Laplace smoothing on the displacement field. Subsequently, we apply a second-phase training with these refined meshes, directing the learning process of the network towards capturing intricate facial details. Our experiments demonstrate that our method further enhances the NeRF rendering based on the initial mesh and achieves performance superior to state-of-the-art methods in reconstructing high-fidelity head avatars with such input.</p></details>|[2503.21886](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21886)|null|

To remove dependency on external gating devices, we introduce a physiology-driven periodic consistency loss that learns patient-specific breathing cycles directly from projections via differentiable optimization. Extensive experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, achieving a 9.93 dB PSNR gain over traditional methods and 2.25 dB improvement against prior Gaussian splatting techniques. By unifying continuous motion modeling with hardware-free period learning, X$^2$ -Gaussian advances high-fidelity 4D CT reconstruction for dynamic clinical imaging.

|**2025-03-27**|**HS-SLAM: Hybrid Representation with Structural Supervision for Improved Dense SLAM**|<details><summary>Show Abstract</summary><p>NeRF-based SLAM has recently achieved promising results in tracking and reconstruction. However, existing methods face challenges in providing sufficient scene representation, capturing structural information, and maintaining global consistency in scenes emerging significant movement or being forgotten. To this end, we present HS-SLAM to tackle these problems. To enhance scene representation capacity, we propose a hybrid encoding network that combines the complementary strengths of hash-grid, tri-planes, and one-blob, improving the completeness and smoothness of reconstruction. Additionally, we introduce structural supervision by sampling patches of non-local pixels rather than individual rays to better capture the scene structure. To ensure global consistency, we implement an active global bundle adjustment (BA) to eliminate camera drifts and mitigate accumulative errors. Experimental results demonstrate that HS-SLAM outperforms the baselines in tracking and reconstruction accuracy while maintaining the efficiency required for robotics.</p></details>|[2503.21778](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21778)|null|
|**2025-03-27**|**Semantic Consistent Language Gaussian Splatting for Point-Level Open-vocabulary Querying**|<details><summary>Show Abstract</summary><p>Open-vocabulary querying in 3D Gaussian Splatting aims to identify semantically relevant regions within a 3D Gaussian representation based on a given text query. Prior work, such as LangSplat, addressed this task by retrieving these regions in the form of segmentation masks on 2D renderings. More recently, OpenGaussian introduced point-level querying, which directly selects a subset of 3D Gaussians. In this work, we propose a point-level querying method that builds upon LangSplat's framework. Our approach improves the framework in two key ways: (a) we leverage masklets from the Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2) to establish semantic consistent ground-truth for distilling the language Gaussians; (b) we introduces a novel two-step querying approach that first retrieves the distilled ground-truth and subsequently uses the ground-truth to query the individual Gaussians. Experimental evaluations on three benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed method achieves better performance compared to state-of-the-art approaches. For instance, our method achieves an mIoU improvement of +20.42 on the 3D-OVS dataset.</p></details>|[2503.21767](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21767)|null|
|**2025-03-27**|**RainyGS: Efficient Rain Synthesis with Physically-Based Gaussian Splatting**|<details><summary>Show Abstract</summary><p>We consider the problem of adding dynamic rain effects to in-the-wild scenes in a physically-correct manner. Recent advances in scene modeling have made significant progress, with NeRF and 3DGS techniques emerging as powerful tools for reconstructing complex scenes. However, while effective for novel view synthesis, these methods typically struggle with challenging scene editing tasks, such as physics-based rain simulation. In contrast, traditional physics-based simulations can generate realistic rain effects, such as raindrops and splashes, but they often rely on skilled artists to carefully set up high-fidelity scenes. This process lacks flexibility and scalability, limiting its applicability to broader, open-world environments. In this work, we introduce RainyGS, a novel approach that leverages the strengths of both physics-based modeling and 3DGS to generate photorealistic, dynamic rain effects in open-world scenes with physical accuracy. At the core of our method is the integration of physically-based raindrop and shallow water simulation techniques within the fast 3DGS rendering framework, enabling realistic and efficient simulations of raindrop behavior, splashes, and reflections. Our method supports synthesizing rain effects at over 30 fps, offering users flexible control over rain intensity -- from light drizzles to heavy downpours. We demonstrate that RainyGS performs effectively for both real-world outdoor scenes and large-scale driving scenarios, delivering more photorealistic and physically-accurate rain effects compared to state-of-the-art methods.

However, most existing VPR datasets are limited to single-viewpoint scenarios, leading to reduced recognition accuracy, particularly in multi-directional driving or feature-sparse scenes. Moreover, obtaining additional data to mitigate these limitations is often expensive. This paper introduces a novel training paradigm to improve the performance of existing VPR networks by enhancing multi-view diversity within current datasets through uncertainty estimation and NeRF-based data augmentation. Specifically, we initially train NeRF using the existing VPR dataset. Then, our devised self-supervised uncertainty estimation network identifies places with high uncertainty. The poses of these uncertain places are input into NeRF to generate new synthetic observations for further training of VPR networks. Additionally, we propose an improved storage method for efficient organization of augmented and original training data. We conducted extensive experiments on three datasets and tested three different VPR backbone networks. The results demonstrate that our proposed training paradigm significantly improves VPR performance by fully utilizing existing data, outperforming other training approaches. We further validated the effectiveness of our approach on self-recorded indoor and outdoor datasets, consistently demonstrating superior results.

|**2025-03-27**|**Frequency-Aware Gaussian Splatting Decomposition**|<details><summary>Show Abstract</summary><p>3D Gaussian Splatting (3D-GS) has revolutionized novel view synthesis with its efficient, explicit representation. However, it lacks frequency interpretability, making it difficult to separate low-frequency structures from fine details. We introduce a frequency-decomposed 3D-GS framework that groups 3D Gaussians that correspond to subbands in the Laplacian Pyrmaids of the input images. Our approach enforces coherence within each subband (i.e., group of 3D Gaussians) through dedicated regularization, ensuring well-separated frequency components. We extend color values to both positive and negative ranges, allowing higher-frequency layers to add or subtract residual details. To stabilize optimization, we employ a progressive training scheme that refines details in a coarse-to-fine manner. Beyond interpretability, this frequency-aware design unlocks a range of practical benefits. Explicit frequency separation enables advanced 3D editing and stylization, allowing precise manipulation of specific frequency bands. It also supports dynamic level-of-detail control for progressive rendering, streaming, foveated rendering and fast geometry interaction. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our method provides improved control and flexibility for emerging applications in scene editing and interactive rendering. Our code will be made publicly available.</p></details>|[2503.21226](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21226)|null|
|**2025-03-27**|**GenFusion: Closing the Loop between Reconstruction and Generation via Videos**|<details><summary>Show Abstract</summary><p>Recently, 3D reconstruction and generation have demonstrated impressive novel view synthesis results, achieving high fidelity and efficiency. However, a notable conditioning gap can be observed between these two fields, e.g., scalable 3D scene reconstruction often requires densely captured views, whereas 3D generation typically relies on a single or no input view, which significantly limits their applications. We found that the source of this phenomenon lies in the misalignment between 3D constraints and generative priors. To address this problem, we propose a reconstruction-driven video diffusion model that learns to condition video frames on artifact-prone RGB-D renderings. Moreover, we propose a cyclical fusion pipeline that iteratively adds restoration frames from the generative model to the training set, enabling progressive expansion and addressing the viewpoint saturation limitations seen in previous reconstruction and generation pipelines. Our evaluation, including view synthesis from sparse view and masked input, validates the effectiveness of our approach.</p></details>|[2503.21219](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21219)|null|
|**2025-03-27**|**StyledStreets: Multi-style Street Simulator with Spatial and Temporal Consistency**|<details><summary>Show Abstract</summary><p>Urban scene reconstruction requires modeling both static infrastructure and dynamic elements while supporting diverse environmental conditions. We present \textbf{StyledStreets}, a multi-style street simulator that achieves instruction-driven scene editing with guaranteed spatial and temporal consistency. Building on a state-of-the-art Gaussian Splatting framework for street scenarios enhanced by our proposed pose optimization and multi-view training, our method enables photorealistic style transfers across seasons, weather conditions, and camera setups through three key innovations: First, a hybrid embedding scheme disentangles persistent scene geometry from transient style attributes, allowing realistic environmental edits while preserving structural integrity. Second, uncertainty-aware rendering mitigates supervision noise from diffusion priors, enabling robust training across extreme style variations. Third, a unified parametric model prevents geometric drift through regularized updates, maintaining multi-view consistency across seven vehicle-mounted cameras.   Our framework preserves the original scene's motion patterns and geometric relationships. Qualitative results demonstrate plausible transitions between diverse conditions (snow, sandstorm, night), while quantitative evaluations show state-of-the-art geometric accuracy under style transfers. The approach establishes new capabilities for urban simulation, with applications in autonomous vehicle testing and augmented reality systems requiring reliable environmental consistency.

Despite recent advancements, existing methods often struggle to balance the need for accurate garment reconstruction with the ability to generalize to new poses and body shapes or require large amounts of data to achieve this. In contrast, our method only requires a multi-view capture of a single static frame. We represent garments as hybrid mesh-embedded 3D Gaussian splats, where the Gaussians capture near-field shading and high-frequency details, while the mesh encodes far-field albedo and optimized reflectance parameters. We achieve novel pose generalization by exploiting the mesh from our hybrid approach, enabling physics-based simulation and surface rendering techniques, while also capturing fine details with Gaussians that accurately reconstruct garment details. Our optimized garments can be used for simulating garments on novel poses, and garment relighting.

However, these methods struggle in few-shot scenarios due to limited supervision. In this paper, we present NexusGS, a 3DGS-based approach that enhances novel view synthesis from sparse-view images by directly embedding depth information into point clouds, without relying on complex manual regularizations. Exploiting the inherent epipolar geometry of 3DGS, our method introduces a novel point cloud densification strategy that initializes 3DGS with a dense point cloud, reducing randomness in point placement while preventing over-smoothing and overfitting. Specifically, NexusGS comprises three key steps: Epipolar Depth Nexus, Flow-Resilient Depth Blending, and Flow-Filtered Depth Pruning. These steps leverage optical flow and camera poses to compute accurate depth maps, while mitigating the inaccuracies often associated with optical flow. By incorporating epipolar depth priors, NexusGS ensures reliable dense point cloud coverage and supports stable 3DGS training under sparse-view conditions. Experiments demonstrate that NexusGS significantly enhances depth accuracy and rendering quality, surpassing state-of-the-art methods by a considerable margin. Furthermore, we validate the superiority of our generated point clouds by substantially boosting the performance of competing methods.

|**2025-03-24**|**GS-Marker: Generalizable and Robust Watermarking for 3D Gaussian Splatting**|<details><summary>Show Abstract</summary><p>In the Generative AI era, safeguarding 3D models has become increasingly urgent. While invisible watermarking is well-established for 2D images with encoder-decoder frameworks, generalizable and robust solutions for 3D remain elusive. The main difficulty arises from the renderer between the 3D encoder and 2D decoder, which disrupts direct gradient flow and complicates training. Existing 3D methods typically rely on per-scene iterative optimization, resulting in time inefficiency and limited generalization. In this work, we propose a single-pass watermarking approach for 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), a well-known yet underexplored representation for watermarking. We identify two major challenges: (1) ensuring effective training generalized across diverse 3D models, and (2) reliably extracting watermarks from free-view renderings, even under distortions. Our framework, named GS-Marker, incorporates a 3D encoder to embed messages, distortion layers to enhance resilience against various distortions, and a 2D decoder to extract watermarks from renderings. A key innovation is the Adaptive Marker Control mechanism that adaptively perturbs the initially optimized 3DGS, escaping local minima and improving both training stability and convergence. Extensive experiments show that GS-Marker outperforms per-scene training approaches in terms of decoding accuracy and model fidelity, while also significantly reducing computation time.</p></details>|[2503.18718](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18718)|null|

Simply using enhanced images as inputs would lead to issues with multi-view consistency, and current single-view enhancement systems rely on pre-trained data, lacking scene generalization. These problems limit the application of 3D Gaussian Splatting in low-light conditions in the field of robotics, including high-fidelity modeling and feature matching. To address these challenges, we propose an unsupervised multi-view stereoscopic system based on Gaussian Splatting, called Low-Light Gaussian Splatting (LLGS). This system aims to enhance images in low-light environments while reconstructing the scene. Our method introduces a decomposable Gaussian representation called M-Color, which separately characterizes color information for targeted enhancement. Furthermore, we propose an unsupervised optimization method with zero-knowledge priors, using direction-based enhancement to ensure multi-view consistency. Experiments conducted on real-world datasets demonstrate that our system outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both low-light enhancement and 3D Gaussian Splatting.</p></details>|[2503.18640](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18640)|null|

We introduce FA-NeRF, a novel frequency-aware framework for view synthesis that simultaneously captures the overall scene structure and high-definition details within a single NeRF model. To achieve this, we propose a 3D frequency quantification method that analyzes the scene's frequency distribution, enabling frequency-aware rendering. Our framework incorporates a frequency grid for fast convergence and querying, a frequency-aware feature re-weighting strategy to balance features across different frequency contents.

However, the vast number of Gaussians and their associated attributes poses significant challenges for storage and transmission. Existing methods typically handle dynamic 3DGS representation and compression separately, neglecting motion information and the rate-distortion (RD) trade-off during training, leading to performance degradation and increased model redundancy. To address this gap, we propose 4DGC, a novel rate-aware 4D Gaussian compression framework that significantly reduces storage size while maintaining superior RD performance for FVV. Specifically, 4DGC introduces a motion-aware dynamic Gaussian representation that utilizes a compact motion grid combined with sparse compensated Gaussians to exploit inter-frame similarities. This representation effectively handles large motions, preserving quality and reducing temporal redundancy. Furthermore, we present an end-to-end compression scheme that employs differentiable quantization and a tiny implicit entropy model to compress the motion grid and compensated Gaussians efficiently. The entire framework is jointly optimized using a rate-distortion trade-off. Extensive experiments demonstrate that 4DGC supports variable bitrates and consistently outperforms existing methods in RD performance across multiple datasets.</p></details>|[2503.18421](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18421)|null|

In this paper, we propose DashGaussian, a scheduling scheme over the optimization complexity of 3DGS that strips redundant complexity to accelerate 3DGS optimization. Specifically, we formulate 3DGS optimization as progressively fitting 3DGS to higher levels of frequency components in the training views, and propose a dynamic rendering resolution scheme that largely reduces the optimization complexity based on this formulation. Besides, we argue that a specific rendering resolution should cooperate with a proper primitive number for a better balance between computing redundancy and fitting quality, where we schedule the growth of the primitives to synchronize with the rendering resolution. Extensive experiments show that our method accelerates the optimization of various 3DGS backbones by 45.7% on average while preserving the rendering quality.</p></details>|[2503.18402](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18402)|null|
|**2025-03-24**|**MonoInstance: Enhancing Monocular Priors via Multi-view Instance Alignment for Neural Rendering and Reconstruction**|<details><summary>Show Abstract</summary><p>Monocular depth priors have been widely adopted by neural rendering in multi-view based tasks such as 3D reconstruction and novel view synthesis. However, due to the inconsistent prediction on each view, how to more effectively leverage monocular cues in a multi-view context remains a challenge. Current methods treat the entire estimated depth map indiscriminately, and use it as ground truth supervision, while ignoring the inherent inaccuracy and cross-view inconsistency in monocular priors. To resolve these issues, we propose MonoInstance, a general approach that explores the uncertainty of monocular depths to provide enhanced geometric priors for neural rendering and reconstruction. Our key insight lies in aligning each segmented instance depths from multiple views within a common 3D space, thereby casting the uncertainty estimation of monocular depths into a density measure within noisy point clouds. For high-uncertainty areas where depth priors are unreliable, we further introduce a constraint term that encourages the projected instances to align with corresponding instance masks on nearby views. MonoInstance is a versatile strategy which can be seamlessly integrated into various multi-view neural rendering frameworks. Our experimental results demonstrate that MonoInstance significantly improves the performance in both reconstruction and novel view synthesis under various benchmarks.</p></details>|[2503.18363](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18363)|null|
|**2025-03-24**|**NeRFPrior: Learning Neural Radiance Field as a Prior for Indoor Scene Reconstruction**|<details><summary>Show Abstract</summary><p>Recently, it has shown that priors are vital for neural implicit functions to reconstruct high-quality surfaces from multi-view RGB images. However, current priors require large-scale pre-training, and merely provide geometric clues without considering the importance of color. In this paper, we present NeRFPrior, which adopts a neural radiance field as a prior to learn signed distance fields using volume rendering for surface reconstruction. Our NeRF prior can provide both geometric and color clues, and also get trained fast under the same scene without additional data. Based on the NeRF prior, we are enabled to learn a signed distance function (SDF) by explicitly imposing a multi-view consistency constraint on each ray intersection for surface inference. Specifically, at each ray intersection, we use the density in the prior as a coarse geometry estimation, while using the color near the surface as a clue to check its visibility from another view angle. For the textureless areas where the multi-view consistency constraint does not work well, we further introduce a depth consistency loss with confidence weights to infer the SDF. Our experimental results outperform the state-of-the-art methods under the widely used benchmarks.</p></details>|[2503.18361](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18361)|null|
