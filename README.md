However, previous research studied these human-centric tasks individually, whose performance is largely limited to the size of the public task-specific datasets. Recent human-centric methods leverage the additional modalities, e.g., depth, to learn fine-grained semantic information, which limits the benefit of pretraining models due to their sensitivity to camera views and the scarcity of RGB-D data on the Internet. This paper improves the data scalability of human-centric pretraining methods by discarding depth information and exploring semantic information of RGB images in the frequency space by Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT). We further propose new annotation denoising auxiliary tasks with keypoints and DCT maps to enforce the RGB image extractor to learn fine-grained semantic information of human bodies. Our extensive experiments show that when pretrained on large-scale datasets (COCO and AIC datasets) without depth annotation, our model achieves better performance than state-of-the-art methods by +0.5 mAP on COCO, +1.4 PCKh on MPII and -0.51 EPE on Human3.6M for pose estimation, by +4.50 mIoU on Human3.6M for human parsing, by -3.14 MAE on SHA and -0.07 MAE on SHB for crowd counting, by +1.1 F1 score on SHA and +0.8 F1 score on SHA for crowd localization, and by +0.1 mAP on Market1501 and +0.8 mAP on MSMT for person ReID. We also validate the effectiveness of our method on MPII+NTURGBD datasets</p></details>|[2504.20800](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20800)|null|
|**2025-04-29**|**A Survey on Event-based Optical Marker Systems**|<details><summary>Show Abstract</summary><p>The advent of event-based cameras, with their low latency, high dynamic range, and reduced power consumption, marked a significant change in robotic vision and machine perception. In particular, the combination of these neuromorphic sensors with widely-available passive or active optical markers (e.g. AprilTags, arrays of blinking LEDs), has recently opened up a wide field of possibilities. This survey paper provides a comprehensive review on Event-Based Optical Marker Systems (EBOMS). We analyze the basic principles and technologies on which these systems are based, with a special focus on their asynchronous operation and robustness against adverse lighting conditions. We also describe the most relevant applications of EBOMS, including object detection and tracking, pose estimation, and optical communication. The article concludes with a discussion of possible future research directions in this rapidly-emerging and multidisciplinary field.</p></details>|[2504.20736](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20736)|null|
|**2025-04-29**|**Large-scale visual SLAM for in-the-wild videos**|<details><summary>Show Abstract</summary><p>Accurate and robust 3D scene reconstruction from casual, in-the-wild videos can significantly simplify robot deployment to new environments. However, reliable camera pose estimation and scene reconstruction from such unconstrained videos remains an open challenge. Existing visual-only SLAM methods perform well on benchmark datasets but struggle with real-world footage which often exhibits uncontrolled motion including rapid rotations and pure forward movements, textureless regions, and dynamic objects. We analyze the limitations of current methods and introduce a robust pipeline designed to improve 3D reconstruction from casual videos. We build upon recent deep visual odometry methods but increase robustness in several ways. Camera intrinsics are automatically recovered from the first few frames using structure-from-motion. Dynamic objects and less-constrained areas are masked with a predictive model. Additionally, we leverage monocular depth estimates to regularize bundle adjustment, mitigating errors in low-parallax situations. Finally, we integrate place recognition and loop closure to reduce long-term drift and refine both intrinsics and pose estimates through global bundle adjustment. We demonstrate large-scale contiguous 3D models from several online videos in various environments. In contrast, baseline methods typically produce locally inconsistent results at several points, producing separate segments or distorted maps. In lieu of ground-truth pose data, we evaluate map consistency, execution time and visual accuracy of re-rendered NeRF models. Our proposed system establishes a new baseline for visual reconstruction from casual uncontrolled videos found online, demonstrating more consistent reconstructions over longer sequences of in-the-wild videos than previously achieved.</p></details>|[2504.20496](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20496)|null|
|**2025-04-29**|**GSFeatLoc: Visual Localization Using Feature Correspondence on 3D Gaussian Splatting**|<details><summary>Show Abstract</summary><p>In this paper, we present a method for localizing a query image with respect to a precomputed 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) scene representation. First, the method uses 3DGS to render a synthetic RGBD image at some initial pose estimate. Second, it establishes 2D-2D correspondences between the query image and this synthetic image. Third, it uses the depth map to lift the 2D-2D correspondences to 2D-3D correspondences and solves a perspective-n-point (PnP) problem to produce a final pose estimate. Results from evaluation across three existing datasets with 38 scenes and over 2,700 test images show that our method significantly reduces both inference time (by over two orders of magnitude, from more than 10 seconds to as fast as 0.1 seconds) and estimation error compared to baseline methods that use photometric loss minimization. Results also show that our method tolerates large errors in the initial pose estimate of up to 55{\deg} in rotation and 1.1 units in translation (normalized by scene scale), achieving final pose errors of less than 5{\deg} in rotation and 0.05 units in translation on 90% of images from the Synthetic NeRF and Mip-NeRF360 datasets and on 42% of images from the more challenging Tanks and Temples dataset.</p></details>|[2504.20379](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20379)|null|
|**2025-04-29**|**PRISM-DP: Spatial Pose-based Observations for Diffusion-Policies via Segmentation, Mesh Generation, and Pose Tracking**|<details><summary>Show Abstract</summary><p>Diffusion-based visuomotor policies generate robot motions by learning to denoise action-space trajectories conditioned on observations. These observations are commonly streams of RGB images, whose high dimensionality includes substantial task-irrelevant information, requiring large models to extract relevant patterns. In contrast, using more structured observations, such as the spatial poses (positions and orientations) of key objects over time, enables training more compact policies that can recognize relevant patterns with fewer parameters. However, obtaining accurate object poses in open-set, real-world environments remains challenging. For instance, it is impractical to assume that all relevant objects are equipped with markers, and recent learning-based 6D pose estimation and tracking methods often depend on pre-scanned object meshes, requiring manual reconstruction. In this work, we propose PRISM-DP, an approach that leverages segmentation, mesh generation, pose estimation, and pose tracking models to enable compact diffusion policy learning directly from the spatial poses of task-relevant objects. Crucially, because PRISM-DP uses a mesh generation model, it eliminates the need for manual mesh processing or creation, improving scalability and usability in open-set, real-world environments. Experiments across a range of tasks in both simulation and real-world settings show that PRISM-DP outperforms high-dimensional image-based diffusion policies and achieves performance comparable to policies trained with ground-truth state information. We conclude with a discussion of the broader implications and limitations of our approach.</p></details>|[2504.20359](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20359)|null|
|**2025-04-28**|**Transformation & Translation Occupancy Grid Mapping: 2-Dimensional Deep Learning Refined SLAM**|<details><summary>Show Abstract</summary><p>SLAM (Simultaneous Localisation and Mapping) is a crucial component for robotic systems, providing a map of an environment, the current location and previous trajectory of a robot. While 3D LiDAR SLAM has received notable improvements in recent years, 2D SLAM lags behind. Gradual drifts in odometry and pose estimation inaccuracies hinder modern 2D LiDAR-odometry algorithms in large complex environments. Dynamic robotic motion coupled with inherent estimation based SLAM processes introduce noise and errors, degrading map quality. Occupancy Grid Mapping (OGM) produces results that are often noisy and unclear. This is due to the fact that evidence based mapping represents maps according to uncertain observations. This is why OGMs are so popular in exploration or navigation tasks. However, this also limits OGMs' effectiveness for specific mapping based tasks such as floor plan creation in complex scenes. To address this, we propose our novel Transformation and Translation Occupancy Grid Mapping (TT-OGM). We adapt and enable accurate and robust pose estimation techniques from 3D SLAM to the world of 2D and mitigate errors to improve map quality using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). We introduce a novel data generation method via deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to build datasets large enough for training a GAN for SLAM error correction. We demonstrate our SLAM in real-time on data collected at Loughborough University. We also prove its generalisability on a variety of large complex environments on a collection of large scale well-known 2D occupancy maps. Our novel approach enables the creation of high quality OGMs in complex scenes, far surpassing the capabilities of current SLAM algorithms in terms of quality, accuracy and reliability.</p></details>|[2504.19654](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19654)|null|
|**2025-04-28**|**GAN-SLAM: Real-Time GAN Aided Floor Plan Creation Through SLAM**|<details><summary>Show Abstract</summary><p>SLAM is a fundamental component of modern autonomous systems, providing robots and their operators with a deeper understanding of their environment. SLAM systems often encounter challenges due to the dynamic nature of robotic motion, leading to inaccuracies in mapping quality, particularly in 2D representations such as Occupancy Grid Maps. These errors can significantly degrade map quality, hindering the effectiveness of specific downstream tasks such as floor plan creation. To address this challenge, we introduce our novel 'GAN-SLAM', a new SLAM approach that leverages Generative Adversarial Networks to clean and complete occupancy grids during the SLAM process, reducing the impact of noise and inaccuracies introduced on the output map. We adapt and integrate accurate pose estimation techniques typically used for 3D SLAM into a 2D form. This enables the quality improvement 3D LiDAR-odometry has seen in recent years to be effective for 2D representations. Our results demonstrate substantial improvements in map fidelity and quality, with minimal noise and errors, affirming the effectiveness of GAN-SLAM for real-world mapping applications within large-scale complex environments. We validate our approach on real-world data operating in real-time, and on famous examples of 2D maps. The improved quality of the output map enables new downstream tasks, such as floor plan drafting, further enhancing the capabilities of autonomous systems. Our novel approach to SLAM offers a significant step forward in the field, improving the usability for SLAM in mapping-based tasks, and offers insight into the usage of GANs for OGM error correction.</p></details>|[2504.19653](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19653)|null|
|**2025-04-28**|**Category-Level and Open-Set Object Pose Estimation for Robotics**|<details><summary>Show Abstract</summary><p>Object pose estimation enables a variety of tasks in computer vision and robotics, including scene understanding and robotic grasping. The complexity of a pose estimation task depends on the unknown variables related to the target object. While instance-level methods already excel for opaque and Lambertian objects, category-level and open-set methods, where texture, shape, and size are partially or entirely unknown, still struggle with these basic material properties. Since texture is unknown in these scenarios, it cannot be used for disambiguating object symmetries, another core challenge of 6D object pose estimation. The complexity of estimating 6D poses with such a manifold of unknowns led to various datasets, accuracy metrics, and algorithmic solutions. This paper compares datasets, accuracy metrics, and algorithms for solving 6D pose estimation on the category-level. Based on this comparison, we analyze how to bridge category-level and open-set object pose estimation to reach generalization and provide actionable recommendations.</p></details>|[2504.19572](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19572)|null|
|**2025-04-25**|**Certifiably-Correct Mapping for Safe Navigation Despite Odometry Drift**|<details><summary>Show Abstract</summary><p>Accurate perception, state estimation and mapping are essential for safe robotic navigation as planners and controllers rely on these components for safety-critical decisions. However, existing mapping approaches often assume perfect pose estimates, an unrealistic assumption that can lead to incorrect obstacle maps and therefore collisions. This paper introduces a framework for certifiably-correct mapping that ensures that the obstacle map correctly classifies obstacle-free regions despite the odometry drift in vision-based localization systems (VIO}/SLAM). By deflating the safe region based on the incremental odometry error at each timestep, we ensure that the map remains accurate and reliable locally around the robot, even as the overall odometry error with respect to the inertial frame grows unbounded.   Our contributions include two approaches to modify popular obstacle mapping paradigms, (I) Safe Flight Corridors, and (II) Signed Distance Fields. We formally prove the correctness of both methods, and describe how they integrate with existing planning and control modules. Simulations using the Replica dataset highlight the efficacy of our methods compared to state-of-the-art techniques. Real-world experiments with a robotic rover show that, while baseline methods result in collisions with previously mapped obstacles, the proposed framework enables the rover to safely stop before potential collisions.</p></details>|[2504.18713](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18713)|null|
|**2025-04-25**|**SSD-Poser: Avatar Pose Estimation with State Space Duality from Sparse Observations**|<details><summary>Show Abstract</summary><p>The growing applications of AR/VR increase the demand for real-time full-body pose estimation from Head-Mounted Displays (HMDs). Although HMDs provide joint signals from the head and hands, reconstructing a full-body pose remains challenging due to the unconstrained lower body. Recent advancements often rely on conventional neural networks and generative models to improve performance in this task, such as Transformers and diffusion models. However, these approaches struggle to strike a balance between achieving precise pose reconstruction and maintaining fast inference speed. To overcome these challenges, a lightweight and efficient model, SSD-Poser, is designed for robust full-body motion estimation from sparse observations. SSD-Poser incorporates a well-designed hybrid encoder, State Space Attention Encoders, to adapt the state space duality to complex motion poses and enable real-time realistic pose reconstruction. Moreover, a Frequency-Aware Decoder is introduced to mitigate jitter caused by variable-frequency motion signals, remarkably enhancing the motion smoothness. Comprehensive experiments on the AMASS dataset demonstrate that SSD-Poser achieves exceptional accuracy and computational efficiency, showing outstanding inference efficiency compared to state-of-the-art methods.</p></details>|[2504.18332](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18332)|null|
|**2025-04-24**|**Dynamic Camera Poses and Where to Find Them**|<details><summary>Show Abstract</summary><p>Annotating camera poses on dynamic Internet videos at scale is critical for advancing fields like realistic video generation and simulation. However, collecting such a dataset is difficult, as most Internet videos are unsuitable for pose estimation. Furthermore, annotating dynamic Internet videos present significant challenges even for state-of-theart methods. In this paper, we introduce DynPose-100K, a large-scale dataset of dynamic Internet videos annotated with camera poses. Our collection pipeline addresses filtering using a carefully combined set of task-specific and generalist models. For pose estimation, we combine the latest techniques of point tracking, dynamic masking, and structure-from-motion to achieve improvements over the state-of-the-art approaches. Our analysis and experiments demonstrate that DynPose-100K is both large-scale and diverse across several key attributes, opening up avenues for advancements in various downstream applications.</p></details>|[2504.17788](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17788)|null|
|**2025-04-24**|**A Guide to Structureless Visual Localization**|<details><summary>Show Abstract</summary><p>Visual localization algorithms, i.e., methods that estimate the camera pose of a query image in a known scene, are core components of many applications, including self-driving cars and augmented / mixed reality systems. State-of-the-art visual localization algorithms are structure-based, i.e., they store a 3D model of the scene and use 2D-3D correspondences between the query image and 3D points in the model for camera pose estimation. While such approaches are highly accurate, they are also rather inflexible when it comes to adjusting the underlying 3D model after changes in the scene. Structureless localization approaches represent the scene as a database of images with known poses and thus offer a much more flexible representation that can be easily updated by adding or removing images. Although there is a large amount of literature on structure-based approaches, there is significantly less work on structureless methods. Hence, this paper is dedicated to providing the, to the best of our knowledge, first comprehensive discussion and comparison of structureless methods. Extensive experiments show that approaches that use a higher degree of classical geometric reasoning generally achieve higher pose accuracy. In particular, approaches based on classical absolute or semi-generalized relative pose estimation outperform very recent methods based on pose regression by a wide margin. Compared with state-of-the-art structure-based approaches, the flexibility of structureless methods comes at the cost of (slightly) lower pose accuracy, indicating an interesting direction for future work.</p></details>|[2504.17636](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17636)|null|
|**2025-04-24**|**Object Pose Estimation by Camera Arm Control Based on the Next Viewpoint Estimation**|<details><summary>Show Abstract</summary><p>We have developed a new method to estimate a Next Viewpoint (NV) which is effective for pose estimation of simple-shaped products for product display robots in retail stores. Pose estimation methods using Neural Networks (NN) based on an RGBD camera are highly accurate, but their accuracy significantly decreases when the camera acquires few texture and shape features at a current view point. However, it is difficult for previous mathematical model-based methods to estimate effective NV which is because the simple shaped objects have few shape features. Therefore, we focus on the relationship between the pose estimation and NV estimation. When the pose estimation is more accurate, the NV estimation is more accurate. Therefore, we develop a new pose estimation NN that estimates NV simultaneously. Experimental results showed that our NV estimation realized a pose estimation success rate 77.3\%, which was 7.4pt higher than the mathematical model-based NV calculation did. Moreover, we verified that the robot using our method displayed 84.2\% of products.</p></details>|[2504.17424](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17424)|null|
|**2025-04-24**|**Bias-Eliminated PnP for Stereo Visual Odometry: Provably Consistent and Large-Scale Localization**|<details><summary>Show Abstract</summary><p>In this paper, we first present a bias-eliminated weighted (Bias-Eli-W) perspective-n-point (PnP) estimator for stereo visual odometry (VO) with provable consistency. Specifically, leveraging statistical theory, we develop an asymptotically unbiased and $\sqrt {n}$ -consistent PnP estimator that accounts for varying 3D triangulation uncertainties, ensuring that the relative pose estimate converges to the ground truth as the number of features increases. Next, on the stereo VO pipeline side, we propose a framework that continuously triangulates contemporary features for tracking new frames, effectively decoupling temporal dependencies between pose and 3D point errors. We integrate the Bias-Eli-W PnP estimator into the proposed stereo VO pipeline, creating a synergistic effect that enhances the suppression of pose estimation errors. We validate the performance of our method on the KITTI and Oxford RobotCar datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that our method: 1) achieves significant improvements in both relative pose error and absolute trajectory error in large-scale environments; 2) provides reliable localization under erratic and unpredictable robot motions. The successful implementation of the Bias-Eli-W PnP in stereo VO indicates the importance of information screening in robotic estimation tasks with high-uncertainty measurements, shedding light on diverse applications where PnP is a key ingredient.</p></details>|[2504.17410](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17410)|null|
|**2025-04-23**|**WiFi based Human Fall and Activity Recognition using Transformer based Encoder Decoder and Graph Neural Networks**|<details><summary>Show Abstract</summary><p>Human pose estimation and action recognition have received attention due to their critical roles in healthcare monitoring, rehabilitation, and assistive technologies. In this study, we proposed a novel architecture named Transformer based Encoder Decoder Network (TED Net) designed for estimating human skeleton poses from WiFi Channel State Information (CSI). TED Net integrates convolutional encoders with transformer based attention mechanisms to capture spatiotemporal features from CSI signals. The estimated skeleton poses were used as input to a customized Directed Graph Neural Network (DGNN) for action recognition. We validated our model on two datasets: a publicly available multi modal dataset for assessing general pose estimation, and a newly collected dataset focused on fall related scenarios involving 20 participants. Experimental results demonstrated that TED Net outperformed existing approaches in pose estimation, and that the DGNN achieves reliable action classification using CSI based skeletons, with performance comparable to RGB based systems. Notably, TED Net maintains robust performance across both fall and non fall cases. These findings highlight the potential of CSI driven human skeleton estimation for effective action recognition, particularly in home environments such as elderly fall detection. In such settings, WiFi signals are often readily available, offering a privacy preserving alternative to vision based methods, which may raise concerns about continuous camera monitoring.</p></details>|[2504.16655](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16655)|null|
|**2025-04-23**|**Assessing the Feasibility of Internet-Sourced Video for Automatic Cattle Lameness Detection**|<details><summary>Show Abstract</summary><p>Cattle lameness is often caused by hoof injuries or interdigital dermatitis, leads to pain and significantly impacts essential physiological activities such as walking, feeding, and drinking. This study presents a deep learning-based model for detecting cattle lameness, sickness, or gait abnormalities using publicly available video data. The dataset consists of 50 unique videos from 40 individual cattle, recorded from various angles in both indoor and outdoor environments. Half of the dataset represents naturally walking (normal/non-lame) cattle, while the other half consists of cattle exhibiting gait abnormalities (lame). To enhance model robustness and generalizability, data augmentation was applied to the training data. The pre-processed videos were then classified using two deep learning models: ConvLSTM2D and 3D CNN. A comparative analysis of the results demonstrates strong classification performance. Specifically, the 3D CNN model achieved a video-level classification accuracy of 90%, with precision, recall, and f1-score of 90.9%, 90.9%, and 90.91% respectively. The ConvLSTM2D model exhibited a slightly lower accuracy of 85%. This study highlights the effectiveness of directly applying classification models to learn spatiotemporal features from video data, offering an alternative to traditional multi-stage approaches that typically involve object detection, pose estimation, and feature extraction. Besides, the findings demonstrate that the proposed deep learning models, particularly the 3D CNN, effectively classify and detect lameness in cattle while simplifying the processing pipeline.</p></details>|[2504.16404](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16404)|null|
|**2025-04-22**|**SignX: The Foundation Model for Sign Recognition**|<details><summary>Show Abstract</summary><p>The complexity of sign language data processing brings many challenges. The current approach to recognition of ASL signs aims to translate RGB sign language videos through pose information into English-based ID glosses, which serve to uniquely identify ASL signs. Note that there is no shared convention for assigning such glosses to ASL signs, so it is essential that the same glossing conventions are used for all of the data in the datasets that are employed. This paper proposes SignX, a foundation model framework for sign recognition. It is a concise yet powerful framework applicable to multiple human activity recognition scenarios. First, we developed a Pose2Gloss component based on an inverse diffusion model, which contains a multi-track pose fusion layer that unifies five of the most powerful pose information sources--SMPLer-X, DWPose, Mediapipe, PrimeDepth, and Sapiens Segmentation--into a single latent pose representation. Second, we trained a Video2Pose module based on ViT that can directly convert raw video into signer pose representation. Through this 2-stage training framework, we enable sign language recognition models to be compatible with existing pose formats, laying the foundation for the common pose estimation necessary for sign recognition. Experimental results show that SignX can recognize signs from sign language video, producing predicted gloss representations with greater accuracy than has been reported in prior work.</p></details>|[2504.16315](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16315)|null|
|**2025-04-22**|**GADS: A Super Lightweight Model for Head Pose Estimation**|<details><summary>Show Abstract</summary><p>In human-computer interaction, head pose estimation profoundly influences application functionality. Although utilizing facial landmarks is valuable for this purpose, existing landmark-based methods prioritize precision over simplicity and model size, limiting their deployment on edge devices and in compute-poor environments. To bridge this gap, we propose \textbf{Grouped Attention Deep Sets (GADS)}, a novel architecture based on the Deep Set framework. By grouping landmarks into regions and employing small Deep Set layers, we reduce computational complexity. Our multihead attention mechanism extracts and combines inter-group information, resulting in a model that is $7.5\times$ smaller and executes $25\times$ faster than the current lightest state-of-the-art model. Notably, our method achieves an impressive reduction, being $4321\times$ smaller than the best-performing model. We introduce vanilla GADS and Hybrid-GADS (landmarks + RGB) and evaluate our models on three benchmark datasets -- AFLW2000, BIWI, and 300W-LP. We envision our architecture as a robust baseline for resource-constrained head pose estimation methods.</p></details>|[2504.15751](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15751)|null|

|**2025-04-21**|**Seeing from Another Perspective: Evaluating Multi-View Understanding in MLLMs**|<details><summary>Show Abstract</summary><p>Multi-view understanding, the ability to reconcile visual information across diverse viewpoints for effective navigation, manipulation, and 3D scene comprehension, is a fundamental challenge in Multi-Modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to be used as embodied agents. While recent MLLMs have shown impressive advances in high-level reasoning and planning, they frequently fall short when confronted with multi-view geometric consistency and cross-view correspondence. To comprehensively evaluate the challenges of MLLMs in multi-view scene reasoning, we propose All-Angles Bench, a benchmark of over 2,100 human carefully annotated multi-view question-answer pairs across 90 diverse real-world scenes. Our six tasks (counting, attribute identification, relative distance, relative direction, object manipulation, and camera pose estimation) specifically test model's geometric correspondence and the capacity to align information consistently across views. Our extensive experiments, benchmark on 27 representative MLLMs including Gemini-2.0-Flash, Claude-3.7-Sonnet, and GPT-4o against human evaluators reveals a substantial performance gap, indicating that current MLLMs remain far from human-level proficiency. Through in-depth analysis, we show that MLLMs are particularly underperforming under two aspects: (1) cross-view correspondence for partially occluded views and (2) establishing the coarse camera poses. These findings highlight the necessity of domain-specific refinements or modules that embed stronger multi-view awareness. We believe that our All-Angles Bench offers valuable insights and contribute to bridging the gap between MLLMs and human-level multi-view understanding.

While prior research combining visual and tactile (visuotactile) information has shown promise, these approaches often struggle with generalization due to the limited availability of visuotactile data. In this paper, we introduce ViTa-Zero, a zero-shot visuotactile pose estimation framework. Our key innovation lies in leveraging a visual model as its backbone and performing feasibility checking and test-time optimization based on physical constraints derived from tactile and proprioceptive observations. Specifically, we model the gripper-object interaction as a spring-mass system, where tactile sensors induce attractive forces, and proprioception generates repulsive forces. We validate our framework through experiments on a real-world robot setup, demonstrating its effectiveness across representative visual backbones and manipulation scenarios, including grasping, object picking, and bimanual handover. Compared to the visual models, our approach overcomes some drastic failure modes while tracking the in-hand object pose. In our experiments, our approach shows an average increase of 55% in AUC of ADD-S and 60% in ADD, along with an 80% lower position error compared to FoundationPose.</p></details>|[2504.13179](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13179)|null|

Recent neural rendering advances have enabled holistic human-scene reconstruction but require pre-calibrated camera and human poses, and days of training time. In this work, we introduce a novel unified framework that simultaneously performs camera tracking, human pose estimation and human-scene reconstruction in an online fashion. 3D Gaussian Splatting is utilized to learn Gaussian primitives for humans and scenes efficiently, and reconstruction-based camera tracking and human pose estimation modules are designed to enable holistic understanding and effective disentanglement of pose and appearance. Specifically, we design a human deformation module to reconstruct the details and enhance generalizability to out-of-distribution poses faithfully. Aiming to learn the spatial correlation between human and scene accurately, we introduce occlusion-aware human silhouette rendering and monocular geometric priors, which further improve reconstruction quality.

Among these factors, camera viewpoints and locations {have been shown} to contribute significantly to the domain gap by influencing the global positions of human poses. To address this, we propose a novel framework that explicitly conducts global transformations between pose positions in the camera coordinate systems of source and target domains. We start with a Pseudo-Label Generation Module that is applied to the 2D poses of the target dataset to generate pseudo-3D poses. Then, a Global Transformation Module leverages a human-centered coordinate system as a novel bridging mechanism to seamlessly align the positional orientations of poses across disparate domains, ensuring consistent spatial referencing. To further enhance generalization, a Pose Augmentor is incorporated to address variations in human posture and body size. This process is iterative, allowing refined pseudo-labels to progressively improve guidance for domain adaptation. Our method is evaluated on various cross-dataset benchmarks, including Human3.6M, MPI-INF-3DHP, and 3DPW. The proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches and even outperforms the target-trained model.</p></details>|[2504.12699](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12699)|null|

However, as these techniques migrate towards lower-fidelity IMUs on ubiquitous commodity devices, like phones, watches, and earbuds, challenges arise including compromised online performance, temporal consistency, and loss of global translation due to sensor noise and drift. Addressing these challenges, we introduce MobilePoser, a real-time system for full-body pose and global translation estimation using any available subset of IMUs already present in these consumer devices. MobilePoser employs a multi-stage deep neural network for kinematic pose estimation followed by a physics-based motion optimizer, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy while remaining lightweight. We conclude with a series of demonstrative applications to illustrate the unique potential of MobilePoser across a variety of fields, such as health and wellness, gaming, and indoor navigation to name a few.</p></details>|[2504.12492](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12492)|null|
|**2025-04-16**|**Diffusion Based Robust LiDAR Place Recognition**|<details><summary>Show Abstract</summary><p>Mobile robots on construction sites require accurate pose estimation to perform autonomous surveying and inspection missions. Localization in construction sites is a particularly challenging problem due to the presence of repetitive features such as flat plastered walls and perceptual aliasing due to apartments with similar layouts inter and intra floors. In this paper, we focus on the global re-positioning of a robot with respect to an accurate scanned mesh of the building solely using LiDAR data. In our approach, a neural network is trained on synthetic LiDAR point clouds generated by simulating a LiDAR in an accurate real-life large-scale mesh. We train a diffusion model with a PointNet++ backbone, which allows us to model multiple position candidates from a single LiDAR point cloud. The resulting model can successfully predict the global position of LiDAR in confined and complex sites despite the adverse effects of perceptual aliasing. The learned distribution of potential global positions can provide multi-modal position distribution. We evaluate our approach across five real-world datasets and show the place recognition accuracy of 77% +/-2m on average while outperforming baselines at a factor of 2 in mean error.</p></details>|[2504.12412](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12412)|null|

While DUSt3R and its successors have achieved breakthroughs in 3D reconstruction from unposed images, these methods exhibit significant limitations when scaling to multi-view scenarios, including high computational cost and cumulative error induced by global alignment. To address these challenges, we propose Regist3R, a novel stereo foundation model tailored for efficient and scalable incremental reconstruction. Regist3R leverages an incremental reconstruction paradigm, enabling large-scale 3D reconstructions from unordered and many-view image collections. We evaluate Regist3R on public datasets for camera pose estimation and 3D reconstruction. Our experiments demonstrate that Regist3R achieves comparable performance with optimization-based methods while significantly improving computational efficiency, and outperforms existing multi-view reconstruction models. Furthermore, to assess its performance in real-world applications, we introduce a challenging oblique aerial dataset which has long spatial spans and hundreds of views. The results highlight the effectiveness of Regist3R. We also demonstrate the first attempt to reconstruct large-scale scenes encompassing over thousands of views through pointmap-based foundation models, showcasing its potential for practical applications in large-scale 3D reconstruction tasks, including urban modeling, aerial mapping, and beyond.</p></details>|[2504.12356](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12356)|null|

Users have the possibility to access the entire Mixed Reality (MR) continuum. Goal of the human-computer-interaction (HCI) community is to allow natural and intuitive interactions but in general interactions for XR often rely on handheld controllers. One natural interaction method is full body tracking (FBT), where a user can use their body to interact with the experience. Classically, FBT systems require markers or trackers on the users to capture motion. Recently, there have been approaches based on Human Pose Estimation (HPE), which highlight the potential of low-cost non-intrusive FBT for XR. Due to the lack of handheld devices, HPE may also improve accessibility with people struggling with traditional input methods. This paper proposes the concept of non-intrusive FBT for XR for all. The goal is to spark a discussion on advantages for users by using a non-intrusive FBT system for accessibility and user experience.</p></details>|[2504.11987](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11987)|null|
|**2025-04-16**|**An Online Adaptation Method for Robust Depth Estimation and Visual Odometry in the Open World**|<details><summary>Show Abstract</summary><p>Recently, learning-based robotic navigation systems have gained extensive research attention and made significant progress. However, the diversity of open-world scenarios poses a major challenge for the generalization of such systems to practical scenarios. Specifically, learned systems for scene measurement and state estimation tend to degrade when the application scenarios deviate from the training data, resulting to unreliable depth and pose estimation. Toward addressing this problem, this work aims to develop a visual odometry system that can fast adapt to diverse novel environments in an online manner. To this end, we construct a self-supervised online adaptation framework for monocular visual odometry aided by an online-updated depth estimation module. Firstly, we design a monocular depth estimation network with lightweight refiner modules, which enables efficient online adaptation. Then, we construct an objective for self-supervised learning of the depth estimation module based on the output of the visual odometry system and the contextual semantic information of the scene. Specifically, a sparse depth densification module and a dynamic consistency enhancement module are proposed to leverage camera poses and contextual semantics to generate pseudo-depths and valid masks for the online adaptation. Finally, we demonstrate the robustness and generalization capability of the proposed method in comparison with state-of-the-art learning-based approaches on urban, in-house datasets and a robot platform.

|**2025-04-17**|**CAP-Net: A Unified Network for 6D Pose and Size Estimation of Categorical Articulated Parts from a Single RGB-D Image**|<details><summary>Show Abstract</summary><p>This paper tackles category-level pose estimation of articulated objects in robotic manipulation tasks and introduces a new benchmark dataset. While recent methods estimate part poses and sizes at the category level, they often rely on geometric cues and complex multi-stage pipelines that first segment parts from the point cloud, followed by Normalized Part Coordinate Space (NPCS) estimation for 6D poses. These approaches overlook dense semantic cues from RGB images, leading to suboptimal accuracy, particularly for objects with small parts. To address these limitations, we propose a single-stage Network, CAP-Net, for estimating the 6D poses and sizes of Categorical Articulated Parts. This method combines RGB-D features to generate instance segmentation and NPCS representations for each part in an end-to-end manner. CAP-Net uses a unified network to simultaneously predict point-wise class labels, centroid offsets, and NPCS maps. A clustering algorithm then groups points of the same predicted class based on their estimated centroid distances to isolate each part. Finally, the NPCS region of each part is aligned with the point cloud to recover its final pose and size. To bridge the sim-to-real domain gap, we introduce the RGBD-Art dataset, the largest RGB-D articulated dataset to date, featuring photorealistic RGB images and depth noise simulated from real sensors. Experimental evaluations on the RGBD-Art dataset demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art approach. Real-world deployments of our model in robotic tasks underscore its robustness and exceptional sim-to-real transfer capabilities, confirming its substantial practical utility. Our dataset, code and pre-trained models are available on the project page.</p></details>|[2504.11230](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11230)|null|

For this task, monocular category-level methods are attractive as they require only a single RGB camera. However, current methods rely on shape priors or CAD models of the intra-class known objects. We propose a diffusion-based monocular category-level 9D object pose generation method, MonoDiff9D. Our motivation is to leverage the probabilistic nature of diffusion models to alleviate the need for shape priors, CAD models, or depth sensors for intra-class unknown object pose estimation. We first estimate coarse depth via DINOv2 from the monocular image in a zero-shot manner and convert it into a point cloud. We then fuse the global features of the point cloud with the input image and use the fused features along with the encoded time step to condition MonoDiff9D. Finally, we design a transformer-based denoiser to recover the object pose from Gaussian noise. Extensive experiments on two popular benchmark datasets show that MonoDiff9D achieves state-of-the-art monocular category-level 9D object pose estimation accuracy without the need for shape priors or CAD models at any stage. Our code will be made public at https://github.com/CNJianLiu/MonoDiff9D.</p></details>|[2504.10433](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10433)|**[link](https://github.com/CNJianLiu/MonoDiff9D.)**|

Using a novel synthetic dataset, BlendMimic3D, which includes diverse scenarios with multi-camera setups and several occlusion types, we conduct specific tests on several state-of-the-art models. Our study focuses on the discrepancy in keypoint formats between common datasets such as Human3.6M, and 2D datasets such as COCO, commonly used for 2D detection models and frequently input of 3D HPE models. Our work explores the impact of occlusions on model performance and the generality of models trained exclusively under standard conditions. The findings suggest significant sensitivity to occlusions and camera settings, revealing a need for models that better adapt to real-world variability and occlusion scenarios. This research contributed to ongoing efforts to improve the fidelity and applicability of 3D HPE systems in complex environments.</p></details>|[2504.10350](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10350)|null|
|**2025-04-15**|**Differentially Private 2D Human Pose Estimation**|<details><summary>Show Abstract</summary><p>Human pose estimation (HPE) has become essential in numerous applications including healthcare, activity recognition, and human-computer interaction. However, the privacy implications of processing sensitive visual data present significant deployment barriers in critical domains. While traditional anonymization techniques offer limited protection and often compromise data utility for broader motion analysis, Differential Privacy (DP) provides formal privacy guarantees but typically degrades model performance when applied naively. In this work, we present the first differentially private 2D human pose estimation (2D-HPE) by applying Differentially Private Stochastic Gradient Descent (DP-SGD) to this task. To effectively balance privacy with performance, we adopt Projected DP-SGD (PDP-SGD), which projects the noisy gradients to a low-dimensional subspace. Additionally, we adapt TinyViT, a compact and efficient vision transformer for coordinate classification in HPE, providing a lightweight yet powerful backbone that enhances privacy-preserving deployment feasibility on resource-limited devices. Our approach is particularly valuable for multimedia interpretation tasks, enabling privacy-safe analysis and understanding of human motion across diverse visual media while preserving the semantic meaning required for downstream applications. Comprehensive experiments on the MPII Human Pose Dataset demonstrate significant performance enhancement with PDP-SGD achieving 78.48% PCKh@0.5 at a strict privacy budget ( $\epsilon=0.2$ ), compared to 63.85% for standard DP-SGD. This work lays foundation for privacy-preserving human pose estimation in real-world, sensitive applications.</p></details>|[2504.10190](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10190)|null|

Advancements in neural networks have significantly alleviated this burden, enabling highly accurate ball tracking in sports broadcasts. However, relying solely on 2D ball tracking is limiting, as it depends on the camera's viewpoint and falls short of supporting comprehensive game analysis. To address this limitation, we propose a novel approach for reconstructing precise 3D ball trajectories from online table tennis match recordings. Our method leverages the underlying physics of the ball's motion to identify the bounce state that minimizes the reprojection error of the ball's flying trajectory, hence ensuring an accurate and reliable 3D reconstruction. A key advantage of our approach is its ability to infer ball spin without relying on human pose estimation or racket tracking, which are often unreliable or unavailable in broadcast footage. We developed an automated camera calibration method capable of reliably tracking camera movements. Additionally, we adapted an existing 3D pose estimation model, which lacks depth motion capture, to accurately track player movements. Together, these contributions enable the full 3D reconstruction of a table tennis rally.</p></details>|[2504.10035](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10035)|null|
|**2025-04-14**|**Efficient 2D to Full 3D Human Pose Uplifting including Joint Rotations**|<details><summary>Show Abstract</summary><p>In sports analytics, accurately capturing both the 3D locations and rotations of body joints is essential for understanding an athlete's biomechanics. While Human Mesh Recovery (HMR) models can estimate joint rotations, they often exhibit lower accuracy in joint localization compared to 3D Human Pose Estimation (HPE) models. Recent work addressed this limitation by combining a 3D HPE model with inverse kinematics (IK) to estimate both joint locations and rotations. However, IK is computationally expensive. To overcome this, we propose a novel 2D-to-3D uplifting model that directly estimates 3D human poses, including joint rotations, in a single forward pass. We investigate multiple rotation representations, loss functions, and training strategies - both with and without access to ground truth rotations. Our models achieve state-of-the-art accuracy in rotation estimation, are 150 times faster than the IK-based approach, and surpass HMR models in joint localization precision.</p></details>|[2504.09953](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09953)|null|

Conventional optical 3D sensors struggle to capture transparent objects, and machine learning methods are often hindered by their reliance on high-quality datasets. Leveraging NeRF's capability for continuous spatial opacity modeling, our proposed architecture integrates a NeRF-based approach for reconstructing the 3D information of transparent objects. Despite this, certain portions of the reconstructed 3D information may remain incomplete. To address these deficiencies, we introduce a shape-prior-driven completion mechanism, further refined by a geometric pose estimation method we have developed. This allows us to obtain a complete and reliable 3D information of transparent objects. Utilizing this refined data, we perform scene-level grasp prediction and deploy the results in real-world robotic systems. Experimental validation demonstrates the efficacy of our architecture, showcasing its capability to reliably capture 3D information of various transparent objects in cluttered scenes, and correspondingly, achieve high-quality, stables, and executable grasp predictions.</p></details>|[2504.09868](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09868)|null|

Traditional registration methods often rely on external fiducial markers to achieve high accuracy and real-time performance. However, these markers introduce cumbersome calibration procedures and can be challenging to deploy in clinical settings. While commercial solutions have attempted real-time markerless tracking using the native RGB cameras of AR devices, their accuracy remains questionable for medical guidance, primarily due to occlusions and significant outliers between the live sensor data and the preoperative target anatomy point cloud derived from MRI or CT scans. In this work, we present a markerless framework that relies only on the depth sensor of AR devices and consists of two modules: a registration module for high-precision, outlier-robust target anatomy localization, and a tracking module for real-time pose estimation. The registration module integrates depth sensor error correction, a human-in-the-loop region filtering technique, and a robust global alignment with curvature-aware feature sampling, followed by local ICP refinement, for markerless alignment of preoperative models with patient anatomy. The tracking module employs a fast and robust registration algorithm that uses the initial pose from the registration module to estimate the target pose in real-time. We comprehensively evaluated the performance of both modules through simulation and real-world measurements. The results indicate that our markerless system achieves superior performance for registration and comparable performance for tracking to industrial solutions. The two-module design makes our system a one-stop solution for surgical procedures where the target anatomy moves or stays static during surgery.</p></details>|[2504.09498](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09498)|null|

Most recent 6D object pose methods rely on refinement to get accurate results. However, most existing refinement methods either suffer from noises in establishing correspondences, or rely on retraining for novel objects. SCFlow2 is based on the SCFlow model designed for refinement with shape constraint, but formulates the additional depth as a regularization in the iteration via 3D scene flow for RGBD frames. The key design of SCFlow2 is an introduction of geometry constraints into the training of recurrent matching network, by combining the rigid-motion embeddings in 3D scene flow and 3D shape prior of the target. We train SCFlow2 on a combination of dataset Objaverse, GSO and ShapeNet, and evaluate on BOP datasets with novel objects. After using our method as a post-processing, most state-of-the-art methods produce significantly better results, without any retraining or fine-tuning.

Typically, the initialization is taken from Structure-from-Motion (SfM) algorithms; however, SfM is time-consuming and restricts the application of 3DGS in real-world scenarios and large-scale scene reconstruction. We introduce a constrained optimization method for simultaneous camera pose estimation and 3D reconstruction that does not require SfM support. Core to our approach is decomposing a camera pose into a sequence of camera-to-(device-)center and (device-)center-to-world optimizations. To facilitate, we propose two optimization constraints conditioned to the sensitivity of each parameter group and restricts each parameter's search space. In addition, as we learn the scene geometry directly from the noisy point clouds, we propose geometric constraints to improve the reconstruction quality. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed method significantly outperforms the existing (multi-modal) 3DGS baseline and methods supplemented by COLMAP on both our collected dataset and two public benchmarks.</p></details>|[2504.09129](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09129)|null|

Despite recent advances, there is no comprehensive pipeline yet for bimanual class-agnostic interaction reconstruction from a monocular RGB video, where two hands and an unknown object are interacting with each other. Previous works tackled the limited hand-object interaction case, where object templates are pre-known or only one hand is involved in the interaction. The bimanual interaction reconstruction exhibits severe occlusions introduced by complex interactions between two hands and an object. To solve this, we first introduce BIGS (Bimanual Interaction 3D Gaussian Splatting), a method that reconstructs 3D Gaussians of hands and an unknown object from a monocular video. To robustly obtain object Gaussians avoiding severe occlusions, we leverage prior knowledge of pre-trained diffusion model with score distillation sampling (SDS) loss, to reconstruct unseen object parts. For hand Gaussians, we exploit the 3D priors of hand model (i.e., MANO) and share a single Gaussian for two hands to effectively accumulate hand 3D information, given limited views. To further consider the 3D alignment between hands and objects, we include the interacting-subjects optimization step during Gaussian optimization. Our method achieves the state-of-the-art accuracy on two challenging datasets, in terms of 3D hand pose estimation (MPJPE), 3D object reconstruction (CDh, CDo, F10), and rendering quality (PSNR, SSIM, LPIPS), respectively.</p></details>|[2504.09097](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09097)|null|

While existing approaches primarily aim to enhance the performance of estimated 2D poses, they often struggle when applied to ground-truth 2D pose data. We observe that achieving accurate 3D pose reconstruction from ground-truth 2D poses requires precise modeling of local pose structures, alongside the ability to extract robust global spatio-temporal features. To address these challenges, we propose a novel Hyper-GCN and Shuffle Mamba (HGMamba) block, which processes input data through two parallel streams: Hyper-GCN and Shuffle-Mamba. The Hyper-GCN stream models the human body structure as hypergraphs with varying levels of granularity to effectively capture local joint dependencies. Meanwhile, the Shuffle Mamba stream leverages a state space model to perform spatio-temporal scanning across all joints, enabling the establishment of global dependencies. By adaptively fusing these two representations, HGMamba achieves strong global feature modeling while excelling at local structure modeling. We stack multiple HGMamba blocks to create three variants of our model, allowing users to select the most suitable configuration based on the desired speed-accuracy trade-off. Extensive evaluations on the Human3.6M and MPI-INF-3DHP benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. HGMamba-B achieves state-of-the-art results, with P1 errors of 38.65 mm and 14.33 mm on the respective datasets.

Despite significant progress in pose estimation algorithms targeting adults, such developments for infants remain limited. Existing algorithms for infant pose estimation, despite achieving commendable performance, depend on fully supervised approaches that require large amounts of labeled data. These algorithms also struggle with poor generalizability under distribution shifts. To address these challenges, we introduce SHIFT: Leveraging SyntHetic Adult Datasets for Unsupervised InFanT Pose Estimation, which leverages the pseudo-labeling-based Mean-Teacher framework to compensate for the lack of labeled data and addresses distribution shifts by enforcing consistency between the student and the teacher pseudo-labels. Additionally, to penalize implausible predictions obtained from the mean-teacher framework, we incorporate an infant manifold pose prior. To enhance SHIFT's self-occlusion perception ability, we propose a novel visibility consistency module for improved alignment of the predicted poses with the original image. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks show that SHIFT significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) pose estimation methods by 5% and supervised infant pose estimation methods by a margin of 16%.

These factors generate difficulties in the accurate recognition of human intentions and the generation of comfortable, socially aware trajectories. To address these issues, we propose SAP-CoPE, a social-aware planning framework that integrates cooperative infrastructure with a novel 3D human pose estimation method and a model predictive control-based controller. This real-time framework formulates an optimization problem that accounts for uncertainty propagation in the camera projection matrix while ensuring human joint coherence. The proposed method is adaptable to single- or multi-camera configurations and can incorporate sparse LiDAR point-cloud data. To enhance safety and comfort in human environments, we integrate a human personal space field based on human pose into a model predictive controller, enabling the system to navigate while avoiding discomfort zones. Extensive evaluations in both simulated and real-world settings demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in generating socially aware trajectories for autonomous systems.</p></details>|[2504.05727](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05727)|**[link](https://github.com/HopeYless/SAP-CoPE-Project)**|
|**2025-04-08**|**POMATO: Marrying Pointmap Matching with Temporal Motion for Dynamic 3D Reconstruction**|<details><summary>Show Abstract</summary><p>3D reconstruction in dynamic scenes primarily relies on the combination of geometry estimation and matching modules where the latter task is pivotal for distinguishing dynamic regions which can help to mitigate the interference introduced by camera and object motion. Furthermore, the matching module explicitly models object motion, enabling the tracking of specific targets and advancing motion understanding in complex scenarios. Recently, the proposed representation of pointmap in DUSt3R suggests a potential solution to unify both geometry estimation and matching in 3D space, but it still struggles with ambiguous matching in dynamic regions, which may hamper further improvement. In this work, we present POMATO, a unified framework for dynamic 3D reconstruction by marrying pointmap matching with temporal motion. Specifically, our method first learns an explicit matching relationship by mapping RGB pixels from both dynamic and static regions across different views to 3D pointmaps within a unified coordinate system. Furthermore, we introduce a temporal motion module for dynamic motions that ensures scale consistency across different frames and enhances performance in tasks requiring both precise geometry and reliable matching, most notably 3D point tracking. We show the effectiveness of the proposed pointmap matching and temporal fusion paradigm by demonstrating the remarkable performance across multiple downstream tasks, including video depth estimation, 3D point tracking, and pose estimation.

Existing methods for extracting affine correspondences still have many limitations in terms of performance; thus, exploring a new paradigm is crucial. In this paper, we present a new pipeline designed for extracting accurate affine correspondences by integrating dense matching and geometric constraints. Specifically, a novel extraction framework is introduced, with the aid of dense matching and a novel keypoint scale and orientation estimator. For this purpose, we propose loss functions based on geometric constraints, which can effectively improve accuracy by supervising neural networks to learn feature geometry. The experimental show that the accuracy and robustness of our method outperform the existing ones in image matching tasks. To further demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, we applied it to relative pose estimation. Affine correspondences extracted by our method lead to more accurate poses than the baselines on a range of real-world datasets.

It is well studied for optical cameras, but research is lacking for 2D forward-looking sonar (FLS) in underwater scenarios due to the vastly different imaging principles. In this paper, we demonstrate that, despite the nonlinearity inherent in sonar image formation, the P$n$ P problem for 2D FLS can still be effectively addressed within a point-to-line (PtL) 3D registration paradigm through orthographic approximation. The registration is then resolved by a duality-based optimal solver, ensuring the global optimality. For coplanar cases, a null space analysis is conducted to retrieve the solutions from the dual formulation, enabling the methods to be applied to more general cases. Extensive simulations have been conducted to systematically evaluate the performance under different settings. Compared to non-reprojection-optimized state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods, the proposed approach achieves significantly higher precision. When both methods are optimized, ours demonstrates comparable or slightly superior precision.</p></details>|[2504.04445](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04445)|null|

Although recent SfM pipelines have made impressive progress, questions remain about how to further improve both their robust performance in challenging conditions (e.g., textureless scenes) and the precision of camera parameter estimation simultaneously. We present 3R-GS, a 3D Gaussian Splatting framework that bridges this gap by jointly optimizing 3D Gaussians and camera parameters from large reconstruction priors MASt3R-SfM. We note that naively performing joint 3D Gaussian and camera optimization faces two challenges: the sensitivity to the quality of SfM initialization, and its limited capacity for global optimization, leading to suboptimal reconstruction results. Our 3R-GS, overcomes these issues by incorporating optimized practices, enabling robust scene reconstruction even with imperfect camera registration. Extensive experiments demonstrate that 3R-GS delivers high-quality novel view synthesis and precise camera pose estimation while remaining computationally efficient.

In 2024, our goal was to transition BOP from lab-like setups to real-world scenarios. First, we introduced new model-free tasks, where no 3D object models are available and methods need to onboard objects just from provided reference videos. Second, we defined a new, more practical 6D object detection task where identities of objects visible in a test image are not provided as input. Third, we introduced new BOP-H3 datasets recorded with high-resolution sensors and AR/VR headsets, closely resembling real-world scenarios. BOP-H3 include 3D models and onboarding videos to support both model-based and model-free tasks. Participants competed on seven challenge tracks, each defined by a task, object onboarding setup, and dataset group. Notably, the best 2024 method for model-based 6D localization of unseen objects (FreeZeV2.1) achieves 22% higher accuracy on BOP-Classic-Core than the best 2023 method (GenFlow), and is only 4% behind the best 2023 method for seen objects (GPose2023) although being significantly slower (24.9 vs 2.7s per image). A more practical 2024 method for this task is Co-op which takes only 0.8s per image and is 25X faster and 13% more accurate than GenFlow. Methods have a similar ranking on 6D detection as on 6D localization but higher run time. On model-based 2D detection of unseen objects, the best 2024 method (MUSE) achieves 21% relative improvement compared to the best 2023 method (CNOS). However, the 2D detection accuracy for unseen objects is still noticealy (-53%) behind the accuracy for seen objects (GDet2023).

In this paper, we introduce PicoPose, a novel framework designed to tackle this task using a three-stage pixel-to-pixel correspondence learning process. Firstly, PicoPose matches features from the RGB observation with those from rendered object templates, identifying the best-matched template and establishing coarse correspondences. Secondly, PicoPose smooths the correspondences by globally regressing a 2D affine transformation, including in-plane rotation, scale, and 2D translation, from the coarse correspondence map. Thirdly, PicoPose applies the affine transformation to the feature map of the best-matched template and learns correspondence offsets within local regions to achieve fine-grained correspondences. By progressively refining the correspondences, PicoPose significantly improves the accuracy of object poses computed via PnP/RANSAC. PicoPose achieves state-of-the-art performance on the seven core datasets of the BOP benchmark, demonstrating exceptional generalization to novel objects represented by CAD models or object reference images.

Monocular 3D human pose estimation is challenged by depth ambiguity, limited 3D-labeled training data, imbalanced modeling, and restricted model generalization. To address these limitations, our work introduces a groundbreaking motion pre-training method based on contextualized representation learning. Specifically, our method involves masking 2D pose features and utilizing a Transformer-GCN dual-stream model to learn high-dimensional representations through a self-distillation setup. By focusing on contextualized representation learning and spatial-temporal modeling, our approach enhances the model's ability to understand spatial-temporal relationships between postures, resulting in superior generalization. Furthermore, leveraging the Transformer-GCN dual-stream model, our approach effectively balances global and local interactions in video pose estimation. The model adaptively integrates information from both the Transformer and GCN streams, where the GCN stream effectively learns local relationships between adjacent key points and frames, while the Transformer stream captures comprehensive global spatial and temporal features. Our model achieves state-of-the-art performance on two benchmark datasets, with an MPJPE of 38.0mm and P-MPJPE of 31.9mm on Human3.6M, and an MPJPE of 15.9mm on MPI-INF-3DHP. Furthermore, visual experiments on public datasets and in-the-wild videos demonstrate the robustness and generalization capabilities of our approach.</p></details>|[2504.01764](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01764)|null|
|**2025-04-02**|**ForestVO: Enhancing Visual Odometry in Forest Environments through ForestGlue**|<details><summary>Show Abstract</summary><p>Recent advancements in visual odometry systems have improved autonomous navigation; however, challenges persist in complex environments like forests, where dense foliage, variable lighting, and repetitive textures compromise feature correspondence accuracy. To address these challenges, we introduce ForestGlue, enhancing the SuperPoint feature detector through four configurations - grayscale, RGB, RGB-D, and stereo-vision - optimised for various sensing modalities. For feature matching, we employ LightGlue or SuperGlue, retrained with synthetic forest data. ForestGlue achieves comparable pose estimation accuracy to baseline models but requires only 512 keypoints - just 25% of the baseline's 2048 - to reach an LO-RANSAC AUC score of 0.745 at a 10{\deg} threshold. With only a quarter of keypoints needed, ForestGlue significantly reduces computational overhead, demonstrating effectiveness in dynamic forest environments, and making it suitable for real-time deployment on resource-constrained platforms. By combining ForestGlue with a transformer-based pose estimation model, we propose ForestVO, which estimates relative camera poses using matched 2D pixel coordinates between frames. On challenging TartanAir forest sequences, ForestVO achieves an average relative pose error (RPE) of 1.09 m and a kitti_score of 2.33%, outperforming direct-based methods like DSO by 40% in dynamic scenes. Despite using only 10% of the dataset for training, ForestVO maintains competitive performance with TartanVO while being a significantly lighter model. This work establishes an end-to-end deep learning pipeline specifically tailored for visual odometry in forested environments, leveraging forest-specific training data to optimise feature correspondence and pose estimation, thereby enhancing the accuracy and robustness of autonomous navigation systems.</p></details>|[2504.01261](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01261)|**[link](https://github.com/aerialroboticsgroup/forest-vo)**|

Despite notable progress in some existing approaches, our study reveals that the scarcity of high-quality datasets remains a significant bottleneck, limiting the full potential of current methods. To address this challenge, we propose a novel Controllable Image Generation Pipeline for synthesizing animal pose estimation data, termed AP-CAP. Within this pipeline, we introduce a Multi-Modal Animal Image Generation Model capable of producing images with expected poses. To enhance the quality and diversity of the generated data, we further propose three innovative strategies: (1) Modality-Fusion-Based Animal Image Synthesis Strategy to integrate multi-source appearance representations, (2) Pose-Adjustment-Based Animal Image Synthesis Strategy to dynamically capture diverse pose variations, and (3) Caption-Enhancement-Based Animal Image Synthesis Strategy to enrich visual semantic understanding. Leveraging the proposed model and strategies, we create the MPCH Dataset (Modality-Pose-Caption Hybrid), the first hybrid dataset that innovatively combines synthetic and real data, establishing the largest-scale multi-source heterogeneous benchmark repository for animal pose estimation to date. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our method in improving both the performance and generalization capability of animal pose estimators.</p></details>|[2504.00394](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00394)|null|

In contrast, the limited scale and diversity of available 4D datasets present a major bottleneck for training a highly generalizable 4D model. This constraint has driven conventional 4D methods to fine-tune 3D models on scalable dynamic video data with additional geometric priors such as optical flow and depths. In this work, we take an opposite path and introduce Easi3R, a simple yet efficient training-free method for 4D reconstruction. Our approach applies attention adaptation during inference, eliminating the need for from-scratch pre-training or network fine-tuning. We find that the attention layers in DUSt3R inherently encode rich information about camera and object motion. By carefully disentangling these attention maps, we achieve accurate dynamic region segmentation, camera pose estimation, and 4D dense point map reconstruction. Extensive experiments on real-world dynamic videos demonstrate that our lightweight attention adaptation significantly outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods that are trained or finetuned on extensive dynamic datasets.

We extract keypoints from the reference image and generate a 3D reference map with 3D reconstruction of the keypoints in advance. We emphasize that the more keypoints in the 3D reference map and the smaller the error of the 3D positions of the keypoints, the higher the accuracy of the camera pose estimation. However, previous image-only methods require a huge number of images, and it is difficult to 3D-reconstruct keypoints without error due to inevitable mismatches and failures in feature matching. As a result, the 3D reference map is sparse and inaccurate. In contrast, accurate 3D reference maps can be generated by combining images and 3D sensors. Recently, 3D-LiDAR has been widely used around the world. LiDAR, which measures a large space with high density, has become inexpensive. In addition, accurately calibrated cameras are also widely used, so images that record the external parameters of the camera without errors can be easily obtained. In this paper, we propose a method to directly assign 3D LiDAR point clouds to keypoints to generate dense and accurate 3D reference maps. The proposed method avoids feature matching and achieves accurate 3D reconstruction for almost all keypoints. To estimate camera pose over a wide area, we use the wide-area LiDAR point cloud to remove points that are not visible to the camera and reduce 2D-3D correspondence errors. Using indoor and outdoor datasets, we apply the proposed method to several state-of-the-art local features and confirm that it improves the accuracy of camera pose estimation.</p></details>|[2503.23664](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23664)|null|

In indoor environments, traditional Monte Carlo localization based on occupancy grid maps is considered the gold standard, but its accuracy is limited by the representation capabilities of the occupancy grid map. In this paper, we address the problem of building an effective map representation that allows to accurately perform probabilistic global localization. To this end, we propose an implicit neural map representation that is able to capture positional and directional geometric features from 2D LiDAR scans to efficiently represent the environment and learn a neural network that is able to predict both, the non-projective signed distance and a direction-aware projective distance for an arbitrary point in the mapped environment. This combination of neural map representation with a light-weight neural network allows us to design an efficient observation model within a conventional Monte Carlo localization framework for pose estimation of a robot in real time. We evaluated our approach to indoor localization on a publicly available dataset for global localization and the experimental results indicate that our approach is able to more accurately localize a mobile robot than other localization approaches employing occupancy or existing neural map representations. In contrast to other approaches employing an implicit neural map representation for 2D LiDAR localization, our approach allows to perform real-time pose tracking after convergence and near real-time global localization.

Modern global localization techniques often depend on dense LiDAR maps, which, while precise, require extensive storage and computational resources. Recent approaches have explored alternative methods, such as sparse maps and learned features, but they suffer from poor robustness and generalization. We propose SparseLoc, a global localization framework that leverages vision-language foundation models to generate sparse, semantic-topometric maps in a zero-shot manner. It combines this map representation with a Monte Carlo localization scheme enhanced by a novel late optimization strategy, ensuring improved pose estimation. By constructing compact yet highly discriminative maps and refining localization through a carefully designed optimization schedule, SparseLoc overcomes the limitations of existing techniques, offering a more efficient and robust solution for global localization. Our system achieves over a 5X improvement in localization accuracy compared to existing sparse mapping techniques. Despite utilizing only 1/500th of the points of dense mapping methods, it achieves comparable performance, maintaining an average global localization error below 5m and 2 degrees on KITTI sequences.</p></details>|[2503.23465](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23465)|null|

However, it remains challenging, particularly for the joint camera pose estimation. Previous approaches have achieved impressive pose-free surface reconstruction results in dense-view settings, but could easily fail for sparse-view scenarios without sufficient visual overlap. In this paper, we propose a new technique for pose-free surface reconstruction, which follows triplane-based signed distance field (SDF) learning but regularizes the learning by explicit points sampled from ray-based diffusion of camera pose estimation. Our key contribution is a novel Geometric Consistent Ray Diffusion model (GCRayDiffusion), where we represent camera poses as neural bundle rays and regress the distribution of noisy rays via a diffusion model. More importantly, we further condition the denoising process of RGRayDiffusion using the triplane-based SDF of the entire scene, which provides effective 3D consistent regularization to achieve multi-view consistent camera pose estimation. Finally, we incorporate RGRayDiffusion into the triplane-based SDF learning by introducing on-surface geometric regularization from the sampling points of the neural bundle rays, which leads to highly accurate pose-free surface reconstruction results even for sparse-view inputs. Extensive evaluations on public datasets show that our GCRayDiffusion achieves more accurate camera pose estimation than previous approaches, with geometrically more consistent surface reconstruction results, especially given sparse-view inputs.</p></details>|[2503.22349](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22349)|null|

Traditional NeRF-based reconstruction methods require cameras to move around stationary objects, but this approach is impractical for high-throughput environments where objects are rapidly imaged while moving on conveyors or rotating pedestals. To address this limitation, we develop a variant of NeRF-based PCD reconstruction that uses a single stationary camera to capture images as the object rotates on a pedestal. Our workflow comprises COLMAP-based pose estimation, a straightforward pose transformation to simulate camera movement, and subsequent standard NeRF training. A defined Region of Interest (ROI) excludes irrelevant scene data, enabling the generation of high-resolution point clouds (10M points). Experimental results demonstrate excellent reconstruction fidelity, with precision-recall analyses yielding an F-score close to 100.00 across all evaluated plant objects. Although pose estimation remains computationally intensive with a stationary camera setup, overall training and reconstruction times are competitive, validating the method's feasibility for practical high-throughput indoor phenotyping applications. Our findings indicate that high-quality NeRF-based 3D reconstructions are achievable using a stationary camera, eliminating the need for complex camera motion or costly imaging equipment. This approach is especially beneficial when employing expensive and delicate instruments, such as hyperspectral cameras, for 3D plant phenotyping. Future work will focus on optimizing pose estimation techniques and further streamlining the methodology to facilitate seamless integration into automated, high-throughput 3D phenotyping pipelines.</p></details>|[2503.21958](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21958)|null|

This problem becomes more prominent when hand interacts with an object or two hands are involved. In the past works, much attention has not been given to these occluded regions. But these regions contain important and beneficial information that is vital for 3D hand pose estimation. Thus, in this paper, we propose an occlusion robust and accurate method for the estimation of 3D hand-object pose from the input RGB image. Our method includes first localising the hand joints using a CNN based model and then refining them by extracting contextual information. The self attention transformer then identifies the specific joints along with the hand identity. This helps the model to identify the hand belongingness of a particular joint which helps to detect the joint even in the occluded region. Further, these joints with hand identity are then used to estimate the pose using cross attention mechanism. Thus, by identifying the joints in the occluded region, the obtained network becomes robust to occlusion. Hence, this network achieves state-of-the-art results when evaluated on the InterHand2.6M, HO3D and H $_2$ O3D datasets.</p></details>|[2503.21723](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21723)|null|

Current SLAM approaches predominantly rely on geometric cues for mapping and localization, but they often fail to ensure semantic consistency, particularly in dynamic or densely populated scenes. To address this limitation, we introduce STAMICS, a novel method that integrates semantic information with 3D Gaussian representations to enhance both localization and mapping accuracy. STAMICS consists of three key components: a 3D Gaussian-based scene representation for high-fidelity reconstruction, a graph-based clustering technique that enforces temporal semantic consistency, and an open-vocabulary system that allows for the classification of unseen objects. Extensive experiments show that STAMICS significantly improves camera pose estimation and map quality, outperforming state-of-the-art methods while reducing reconstruction errors. Code will be public available.</p></details>|[2503.21425](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21425)|null|

Many existing approaches to the problem use a scan-to-map registration, which neglects the accumulation of errors within the maintained map due to drift. Other methods use a refinement step that jointly optimizes the local map on a feature basis. We propose a solution that avoids this by using multiple independent scan-to-scan Iterative Closest Points (ICP) registrations to previous scans in order to derive constraints for a pose graph. The optimization of the pose graph then not only yields an accurate estimate for the latest pose, but also enables the refinement of previous scans in the optimization window. By avoiding the need to recompute the scan-to-scan alignments, the computational load is minimized. Extensive evaluation on the public KITTI and MulRan datasets as well as on a custom automotive lidar dataset is carried out. Results show that the proposed approach achieves state-of-the-art estimation accuracy, while alleviating the mentioned issues.</p></details>|[2503.21293](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21293)|null|

Existing methods generally extract support features via heatmap pooling, and obtain interacted features from support and query via cross-attention. Hence, these works neglect to mine fine-grained and structure-aware (FGSA) features from both support and query images, which are crucial for pixel-level keypoint localization. To this end, we propose a novel yet concise framework, which recurrently mines FGSA features from both support and query images. Specifically, we design a FGSA mining module based on deformable attention mechanism. On the one hand, we mine fine-grained features by applying deformable attention head over multi-scale feature maps. On the other hand, we mine structure-aware features by offsetting the reference points of keypoints to their linked keypoints. By means of above module, we recurrently mine FGSA features from support and query images, and thus obtain better support features and query estimations. In addition, we propose to use mixup keypoints to pad various classes to a unified keypoint number, which could provide richer supervision than the zero padding used in existing works. We conduct extensive experiments and in-depth studies on large-scale MP-100 dataset, and outperform SOTA method dramatically (+3.2\%PCK@0.05).

Recent works explored neural mesh models that approach a range of 2D and 3D tasks from an analysis-by-synthesis perspective. Despite the largely enhanced robustness to partial occlusion and domain shifts, these methods depended heavily on 3D annotations for part-contrastive learning, which confines them to a narrow set of categories and hinders efficient scaling. In this work, we present DINeMo, a novel neural mesh model that is trained with no 3D annotations by leveraging pseudo-correspondence obtained from large visual foundation models. We adopt a bidirectional pseudo-correspondence generation method, which produce pseudo correspondence utilize both local appearance features and global context information. Experimental results on car datasets demonstrate that our DINeMo outperforms previous zero- and few-shot 3D pose estimation by a wide margin, narrowing the gap with fully-supervised methods by 67.3%. Our DINeMo also scales effectively and efficiently when incorporating more unlabeled images during training, which demonstrate the advantages over supervised learning methods that rely on 3D annotations.

However, acquiring 3D HOI data is challenging due to its complexity and high cost, limiting existing methods to the narrow diversity of object types and interaction patterns in training datasets. This paper proposes a novel zero-shot HOI synthesis framework without relying on end-to-end training on currently limited 3D HOI datasets. The core idea of our method lies in leveraging extensive HOI knowledge from pre-trained Multimodal Models. Given a text description, our system first obtains temporally consistent 2D HOI image sequences using image or video generation models, which are then uplifted to 3D HOI milestones of human and object poses. We employ pre-trained human pose estimation models to extract human poses and introduce a generalizable category-level 6-DoF estimation method to obtain the object poses from 2D HOI images. Our estimation method is adaptive to various object templates obtained from text-to-3D models or online retrieval. A physics-based tracking of the 3D HOI kinematic milestone is further applied to refine both body motions and object poses, yielding more physically plausible HOI generation results. The experimental results demonstrate that our method is capable of generating open-vocabulary HOIs with physical realism and semantic diversity.</p></details>|[2503.20118](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20118)|null|

Here, we propose that combining visual information and proprioception with binary, low-resolution tactile contact measurements from across the interior surface of an articulated robotic hand can mitigate this issue. The visuo-tactile object-pose-estimation problem is formulated probabilistically in a factor graph. The pose of the object is optimized to align with the three kinds of measurements using a robust cost function to reduce the influence of visual or tactile outlier readings. The advantages of the proposed approach are first demonstrated in simulation: a custom 15-DoF robot hand with one binary tactile sensor per link grasps 17 YCB objects while observed by an RGB-D camera. This low-resolution in-hand tactile sensing significantly improves object-pose estimates under high occlusion and also high visual noise. We also show these benefits through grasping tests with a preliminary real version of our tactile hand, obtaining reasonable visuo-tactile estimates of object pose at approximately 13.3 Hz on average.</p></details>|[2503.19893](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19893)|null|

|**2025-03-24**|**Structure-Aware Correspondence Learning for Relative Pose Estimation**|<details><summary>Show Abstract</summary><p>Relative pose estimation provides a promising way for achieving object-agnostic pose estimation. Despite the success of existing 3D correspondence-based methods, the reliance on explicit feature matching suffers from small overlaps in visible regions and unreliable feature estimation for invisible regions. Inspired by humans' ability to assemble two object parts that have small or no overlapping regions by considering object structure, we propose a novel Structure-Aware Correspondence Learning method for Relative Pose Estimation, which consists of two key modules. First, a structure-aware keypoint extraction module is designed to locate a set of kepoints that can represent the structure of objects with different shapes and appearance, under the guidance of a keypoint based image reconstruction loss. Second, a structure-aware correspondence estimation module is designed to model the intra-image and inter-image relationships between keypoints to extract structure-aware features for correspondence estimation. By jointly leveraging these two modules, the proposed method can naturally estimate 3D-3D correspondences for unseen objects without explicit feature matching for precise relative pose estimation. Experimental results on the CO3D, Objaverse and LineMOD datasets demonstrate that the proposed method significantly outperforms prior methods, i.e., with 5.7{\deg}reduction in mean angular error on the CO3D dataset.</p></details>|[2503.18671](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18671)|null|

However, existing datasets and methodologies primarily target mainstream team sports such as soccer and conventional 5-on-5 basketball, often overlooking scenarios involving fixed-camera setups commonly used at amateur levels, less mainstream sports, or datasets that explicitly incorporate pose annotations. In this paper, we propose the TrackID3x3 dataset, the first publicly available comprehensive dataset specifically designed for multi-player tracking, player identification, and pose estimation in 3x3 basketball scenarios. The dataset comprises three distinct subsets (Indoor fixed-camera, Outdoor fixed-camera, and Drone camera footage), capturing diverse full-court camera perspectives and environments. We also introduce the Track-ID task, a simplified variant of the game state reconstruction task that excludes field detection and focuses exclusively on fixed-camera scenarios. To evaluate performance, we propose a baseline algorithm called Track-ID algorithm, tailored to assess tracking and identification quality. Furthermore, our benchmark experiments, utilizing recent multi-object tracking algorithms (e.g., BoT-SORT-ReID) and top-down pose estimation methods (HRNet, RTMPose, and SwinPose), demonstrate robust results and highlight remaining challenges. Our dataset and evaluation benchmarks provide a solid foundation for advancing automated analytics in 3x3 basketball.

Previous methods either treat the information equally or require the explicit storage of the entire context, tending to be laborious in real-world scenarios. Inspired by Mamba's inherent selectivity, we propose \textbf{CorrMamba}, a \textbf{Corr}espondence filter leveraging \textbf{Mamba}'s ability to selectively mine information from true correspondences while mitigating interference from false ones, thus achieving adaptive focus at a lower cost. To prevent Mamba from being potentially impacted by unordered keypoints that obscured its ability to mine spatial information, we customize a causal sequential learning approach based on the Gumbel-Softmax technique to establish causal dependencies between features in a fully autonomous and differentiable manner. Additionally, a local-context enhancement module is designed to capture critical contextual cues essential for correspondence pruning, complementing the core framework. Extensive experiments on relative pose estimation, visual localization, and analysis demonstrate that CorrMamba achieves state-of-the-art performance. Notably, in outdoor relative pose estimation, our method surpasses the previous SOTA by $2.58$ absolute percentage points in AUC@20\textdegree, highlighting its practical superiority.

Our method requires only the CAD model of the target object and can precisely estimate its pose without any additional fine-tuning. While existing model-based methods suffer from inefficiency due to using a large number of templates, our method enables fast and accurate estimation with a small number of templates. This improvement is achieved by finding semi-dense correspondences between the input image and the pre-rendered templates. Our method achieves strong generalization performance by leveraging a hybrid representation that combines patch-level classification and offset regression. Additionally, our pose refinement model estimates probabilistic flow between the input image and the rendered image, refining the initial estimate to an accurate pose using a differentiable PnP layer. We demonstrate that our method not only estimates object poses rapidly but also outperforms existing methods by a large margin on the seven core datasets of the BOP Challenge, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy.</p></details>|[2503.17731](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17731)|null|

In this work, we propose a novel framework that leverages motion blur as a rich cue for motion estimation rather than treating it as an unwanted artifact. Our approach works by predicting a dense motion flow field and a monocular depth map directly from a single motion-blurred image. We then recover the instantaneous camera velocity by solving a linear least squares problem under the small motion assumption. In essence, our method produces an IMU-like measurement that robustly captures fast and aggressive camera movements. To train our model, we construct a large-scale dataset with realistic synthetic motion blur derived from ScanNet++v2 and further refine our model by training end-to-end on real data using our fully differentiable pipeline. Extensive evaluations on real-world benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art angular and translational velocity estimates, outperforming current methods like MASt3R and COLMAP.</p></details>|[2503.17358](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17358)|null|

Unlike previous feed-forward models that lack any mechanism to exploit known camera or scene priors at test time, Pow3r incorporates any combination of auxiliary information such as intrinsics, relative pose, dense or sparse depth, alongside input images, within a single network. Building upon the recent DUSt3R paradigm, a transformer-based architecture that leverages powerful pre-training, our lightweight and versatile conditioning acts as additional guidance for the network to predict more accurate estimates when auxiliary information is available. During training we feed the model with random subsets of modalities at each iteration, which enables the model to operate under different levels of known priors at test time. This in turn opens up new capabilities, such as performing inference in native image resolution, or point-cloud completion. Our experiments on 3D reconstruction, depth completion, multi-view depth prediction, multi-view stereo, and multi-view pose estimation tasks yield state-of-the-art results and confirm the effectiveness of Pow3r at exploiting all available information.

We first validate the contact occupancy sensor in simulation and show its ability to detect the contact location on the robot from force sensing information.

This paper challenges the problem by efficient prompt learning for Vision-Language Pretrained (VLP) models, \textit{e.g.} CLIP, aiming to resolve the cross-species generalization problem. At the core of the solution lies in the prompt designing, probabilistic prompt modeling and cross-modal adaptation, thereby enabling prompts to compensate for cross-modal information and effectively overcome large data variances under unbalanced data distribution. To this end, we propose a novel probabilistic prompting approach to fully explore textual descriptions, which could alleviate the diversity issues caused by long-tail property and increase the adaptability of prompts on unseen category instance. Specifically, we first introduce a set of learnable prompts and propose a diversity loss to maintain distinctiveness among prompts, thus representing diverse image attributes. Diverse textual probabilistic representations are sampled and used as the guidance for the pose estimation. Subsequently, we explore three different cross-modal fusion strategies at spatial level to alleviate the adverse impacts of visual uncertainty. Extensive experiments on multi-species animal pose benchmarks show that our method achieves the state-of-the-art performance under both supervised and zero-shot settings.

First, the method uses 3DGS to render a synthetic RGBD image at some initial pose estimate. Second, it establishes 2D-2D correspondences between the query image and this synthetic image. Third, it uses the depth map to lift the 2D-2D correspondences to 2D-3D correspondences and solves a perspective-n-point (PnP) problem to produce a final pose estimate. Results from evaluation across three existing datasets with 38 scenes and over 2,700 test images show that our method significantly reduces both inference time (by over two orders of magnitude, from more than 10 seconds to as fast as 0.1 seconds) and estimation error compared to baseline methods that use photometric loss minimization. Results also show that our method tolerates large errors in the initial pose estimate of up to 55{\deg} in rotation and 1.1 units in translation (normalized by scene scale), achieving final pose errors of less than 5{\deg} in rotation and 0.05 units in translation on 90% of images from the Synthetic NeRF and Mip-NeRF360 datasets and on 42% of images from the more challenging Tanks and Temples dataset.</p></details>|[2504.20379](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20379)|null|

Due to the high cost of annotating CIR triplet datasets, zero-shot (ZS) CIR has gained traction as a promising alternative. Existing studies mainly focus on projection-based methods, which map an image to a single pseudo-word token. However, these methods face three critical challenges: (1) insufficient pseudo-word token representation capacity, (2) discrepancies between training and inference phases, and (3) reliance on large-scale synthetic data. To address these issues, we propose a two-stage framework where the training is accomplished from mapping to composing. In the first stage, we enhance image-to-pseudo-word token learning by introducing a visual semantic injection module and a soft text alignment objective, enabling the token to capture richer and fine-grained image information. In the second stage, we optimize the text encoder using a small amount of synthetic triplet data, enabling it to effectively extract compositional semantics by combining pseudo-word tokens with modification text for accurate target image retrieval. The strong visual-to-pseudo mapping established in the first stage provides a solid foundation for the second stage, making our approach compatible with both high- and low-quality synthetic data, and capable of achieving significant performance gains with only a small amount of synthetic data. Extensive experiments were conducted on three public datasets, achieving superior performance compared to existing approaches.</p></details>|[2504.17990](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17990)|null|
|**2025-04-24**|**A Guide to Structureless Visual Localization**|<details><summary>Show Abstract</summary><p>Visual localization algorithms, i.e., methods that estimate the camera pose of a query image in a known scene, are core components of many applications, including self-driving cars and augmented / mixed reality systems. State-of-the-art visual localization algorithms are structure-based, i.e., they store a 3D model of the scene and use 2D-3D correspondences between the query image and 3D points in the model for camera pose estimation. While such approaches are highly accurate, they are also rather inflexible when it comes to adjusting the underlying 3D model after changes in the scene. Structureless localization approaches represent the scene as a database of images with known poses and thus offer a much more flexible representation that can be easily updated by adding or removing images. Although there is a large amount of literature on structure-based approaches, there is significantly less work on structureless methods. Hence, this paper is dedicated to providing the, to the best of our knowledge, first comprehensive discussion and comparison of structureless methods. Extensive experiments show that approaches that use a higher degree of classical geometric reasoning generally achieve higher pose accuracy. In particular, approaches based on classical absolute or semi-generalized relative pose estimation outperform very recent methods based on pose regression by a wide margin. Compared with state-of-the-art structure-based approaches, the flexibility of structureless methods comes at the cost of (slightly) lower pose accuracy, indicating an interesting direction for future work.</p></details>|[2504.17636](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17636)|null|

Recently, Vision Transformers (ViT) have been employed in FGIR due to their powerful self-attention mechanism for modeling long-range dependencies. However, most Transformer-based methods focus primarily on leveraging self-attention to distinguish fine-grained details, while overlooking the high computational complexity and redundant dependencies inherent to these models, limiting their scalability and effectiveness in large-scale FGIR. In this paper, we propose an Efficient and Effective ViT-based framework, termed \textbf{EET}, which integrates token pruning module with a discriminative transfer strategy to address these limitations. Specifically, we introduce a content-based token pruning scheme to enhance the efficiency of the vanilla ViT, progressively removing background or low-discriminative tokens at different stages by exploiting feature responses and self-attention mechanism. To ensure the resulting efficient ViT retains strong discriminative power, we further present a discriminative transfer strategy comprising both \textit{discriminative knowledge transfer} and \textit{discriminative region guidance}. Using a distillation paradigm, these components transfer knowledge from a larger ``teacher'' ViT to a more efficient ``student'' model, guiding the latter to focus on subtle yet crucial regions in a cost-free manner. Extensive experiments on two widely-used fine-grained datasets and four large-scale fine-grained datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. Specifically, EET reduces the inference latency of ViT-Small by 42.7\% and boosts the retrieval performance of 16-bit hash codes by 5.15\% on the challenging NABirds dataset.</p></details>|[2504.16691](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16691)|null|

Differences are evident when speakers come from diverse cultures due to the unique experiences that shape perception. Machine translation of captions has pushed multilingual capabilities in vision-language models (VLMs), but data comes mainly from English speakers, indicating a perceptual bias and lack of model flexibility. In this work, we address this challenge and outline a data-efficient framework to instill multilingual VLMs with greater understanding of perceptual diversity. We specifically propose an LLM-based, multimodal recaptioning strategy that alters the object descriptions of English captions before translation. The greatest benefits are demonstrated in a targeted multimodal mechanism guided by native speaker data. By adding produced rewrites as augmentations in training, we improve on German and Japanese text-image retrieval cases studies (up to +3.5 mean recall overall, +4.7 on non-native error cases). We further propose a mechanism to analyze the specific object description differences across datasets, and we offer insights into cross-dataset and cross-language generalization.</p></details>|[2504.14359](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14359)|null|

While traditional CMR methods match text and image via embedding-based similarity calculations, recent advancements in pre-trained generative models have established generative retrieval as a promising alternative. This paradigm assigns each target a unique identifier and leverages a generative model to directly predict identifiers corresponding to input queries without explicit indexing. Despite its great potential, current generative CMR approaches still face semantic information insufficiency in both identifier construction and generation processes. To address these limitations, we propose a novel unified Semantic-enhanced generative Cross-mOdal REtrieval framework (SemCORE), designed to unleash the semantic understanding capabilities in generative cross-modal retrieval task. Specifically, we first construct a Structured natural language IDentifier (SID) that effectively aligns target identifiers with generative models optimized for natural language comprehension and generation. Furthermore, we introduce a Generative Semantic Verification (GSV) strategy enabling fine-grained target discrimination. Additionally, to the best of our knowledge, SemCORE is the first framework to simultaneously consider both text-to-image and image-to-text retrieval tasks within generative cross-modal retrieval. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework outperforms state-of-the-art generative cross-modal retrieval methods. Notably, SemCORE achieves substantial improvements across benchmark datasets, with an average increase of 8.65 points in Recall@1 for text-to-image retrieval.</p></details>|[2504.13172](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13172)|null|
|**2025-04-16**|**Generalized Visual Relation Detection with Diffusion Models**|<details><summary>Show Abstract</summary><p>Visual relation detection (VRD) aims to identify relationships (or interactions) between object pairs in an image. Although recent VRD models have achieved impressive performance, they are all restricted to pre-defined relation categories, while failing to consider the semantic ambiguity characteristic of visual relations. Unlike objects, the appearance of visual relations is always subtle and can be described by multiple predicate words from different perspectives, e.g., ``ride'' can be depicted as ``race'' and ``sit on'', from the sports and spatial position views, respectively. To this end, we propose to model visual relations as continuous embeddings, and design diffusion models to achieve generalized VRD in a conditional generative manner, termed Diff-VRD. We model the diffusion process in a latent space and generate all possible relations in the image as an embedding sequence. During the generation, the visual and text embeddings of subject-object pairs serve as conditional signals and are injected via cross-attention. After the generation, we design a subsequent matching stage to assign the relation words to subject-object pairs by considering their semantic similarities. Benefiting from the diffusion-based generative process, our Diff-VRD is able to generate visual relations beyond the pre-defined category labels of datasets. To properly evaluate this generalized VRD task, we introduce two evaluation metrics, i.e., text-to-image retrieval and SPICE PR Curve inspired by image captioning. Extensive experiments in both human-object interaction (HOI) detection and scene graph generation (SGG) benchmarks attest to the superiority and effectiveness of Diff-VRD.</p></details>|[2504.12100](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12100)|null|
|**2025-04-15**|**Visual Re-Ranking with Non-Visual Side Information**|<details><summary>Show Abstract</summary><p>The standard approach for visual place recognition is to use global image descriptors to retrieve the most similar database images for a given query image. The results can then be further improved with re-ranking methods that re-order the top scoring images. However, existing methods focus on re-ranking based on the same image descriptors that were used for the initial retrieval, which we argue provides limited additional signal.   In this work we propose Generalized Contextual Similarity Aggregation (GCSA), which is a graph neural network-based re-ranking method that, in addition to the visual descriptors, can leverage other types of available side information. This can for example be other sensor data (such as signal strength of nearby WiFi or BlueTooth endpoints) or geometric properties such as camera poses for database images. In many applications this information is already present or can be acquired with low effort. Our architecture leverages the concept of affinity vectors to allow for a shared encoding of the heterogeneous multi-modal input. Two large-scale datasets, covering both outdoor and indoor localization scenarios, are utilized for training and evaluation. In experiments we show significant improvement not only on image retrieval metrics, but also for the downstream visual localization task.</p></details>|[2504.11134](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11134)|**[link](https://github.com/ghanning/gcsa)**|
|**2025-04-15**|**TMCIR: Token Merge Benefits Composed Image Retrieval**|<details><summary>Show Abstract</summary><p>Composed Image Retrieval (CIR) retrieves target images using a multi-modal query that combines a reference image with text describing desired modifications. The primary challenge is effectively fusing this visual and textual information. Current cross-modal feature fusion approaches for CIR exhibit an inherent bias in intention interpretation. These methods tend to disproportionately emphasize either the reference image features (visual-dominant fusion) or the textual modification intent (text-dominant fusion through image-to-text conversion). Such an imbalanced representation often fails to accurately capture and reflect the actual search intent of the user in the retrieval results. To address this challenge, we propose TMCIR, a novel framework that advances composed image retrieval through two key innovations: 1) Intent-Aware Cross-Modal Alignment. We first fine-tune CLIP encoders contrastively using intent-reflecting pseudo-target images, synthesized from reference images and textual descriptions via a diffusion model. This step enhances the encoder ability of text to capture nuanced intents in textual descriptions. 2) Adaptive Token Fusion. We further fine-tune all encoders contrastively by comparing adaptive token-fusion features with the target image. This mechanism dynamically balances visual and textual representations within the contrastive learning pipeline, optimizing the composed feature for retrieval. Extensive experiments on Fashion-IQ and CIRR datasets demonstrate that TMCIR significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, particularly in capturing nuanced user intent.</p></details>|[2504.10995](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10995)|null|
|**2025-04-14**|**Focus on Local: Finding Reliable Discriminative Regions for Visual Place Recognition**|<details><summary>Show Abstract</summary><p>Visual Place Recognition (VPR) is aimed at predicting the location of a query image by referencing a database of geotagged images. For VPR task, often fewer discriminative local regions in an image produce important effects while mundane background regions do not contribute or even cause perceptual aliasing because of easy overlap. However, existing methods lack precisely modeling and full exploitation of these discriminative regions. In this paper, we propose the Focus on Local (FoL) approach to stimulate the performance of image retrieval and re-ranking in VPR simultaneously by mining and exploiting reliable discriminative local regions in images and introducing pseudo-correlation supervision. First, we design two losses, Extraction-Aggregation Spatial Alignment Loss (SAL) and Foreground-Background Contrast Enhancement Loss (CEL), to explicitly model reliable discriminative local regions and use them to guide the generation of global representations and efficient re-ranking. Second, we introduce a weakly-supervised local feature training strategy based on pseudo-correspondences obtained from aggregating global features to alleviate the lack of local correspondences ground truth for the VPR task. Third, we suggest an efficient re-ranking pipeline that is efficiently and precisely based on discriminative region guidance. Finally, experimental results show that our FoL achieves the state-of-the-art on multiple VPR benchmarks in both image retrieval and re-ranking stages and also significantly outperforms existing two-stage VPR methods in terms of computational efficiency.

|**2025-04-12**|**Evolved Hierarchical Masking for Self-Supervised Learning**|<details><summary>Show Abstract</summary><p>Existing Masked Image Modeling methods apply fixed mask patterns to guide the self-supervised training. As those mask patterns resort to different criteria to depict image contents, sticking to a fixed pattern leads to a limited vision cues modeling capability.This paper introduces an evolved hierarchical masking method to pursue general visual cues modeling in self-supervised learning. The proposed method leverages the vision model being trained to parse the input visual cues into a hierarchy structure, which is hence adopted to generate masks accordingly. The accuracy of hierarchy is on par with the capability of the model being trained, leading to evolved mask patterns at different training stages. Initially, generated masks focus on low-level visual cues to grasp basic textures, then gradually evolve to depict higher-level cues to reinforce the learning of more complicated object semantics and contexts. Our method does not require extra pre-trained models or annotations and ensures training efficiency by evolving the training difficulty. We conduct extensive experiments on seven downstream tasks including partial-duplicate image retrieval relying on low-level details, as well as image classification and semantic segmentation that require semantic parsing capability. Experimental results demonstrate that it substantially boosts performance across these tasks. For instance, it surpasses the recent MAE by 1.1\% in imageNet-1K classification and 1.4\% in ADE20K segmentation with the same training epochs. We also align the proposed method with the current research focus on LLMs. The proposed approach bridges the gap with large-scale pre-training on semantic demanding tasks and enhances intricate detail perception in tasks requiring low-level feature recognition.</p></details>|[2504.09155](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09155)|null|
|**2025-04-11**|**HAL-NeRF: High Accuracy Localization Leveraging Neural Radiance Fields**|<details><summary>Show Abstract</summary><p>Precise camera localization is a critical task in XR applications and robotics. Using only the camera captures as input to a system is an inexpensive option that enables localization in large indoor and outdoor environments, but it presents challenges in achieving high accuracy. Specifically, camera relocalization methods, such as Absolute Pose Regression (APR), can localize cameras with a median translation error of more than $0.5m$ in outdoor scenes. This paper presents HAL-NeRF, a high-accuracy localization method that combines a CNN pose regressor with a refinement module based on a Monte Carlo particle filter. The Nerfacto model, an implementation of Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs), is used to augment the data for training the pose regressor and to measure photometric loss in the particle filter refinement module. HAL-NeRF leverages Nerfacto's ability to synthesize high-quality novel views, significantly improving the performance of the localization pipeline. HAL-NeRF achieves state-of-the-art results that are conventionally measured as the average of the median per scene errors. The translation error was $0.025m$ and the rotation error was $0.59$ degrees and 0.04m and 0.58 degrees on the 7-Scenes dataset and Cambridge Landmarks datasets respectively, with the trade-off of increased computational time. This work highlights the potential of combining APR with NeRF-based refinement techniques to advance monocular camera relocalization accuracy.</p></details>|[2504.08901](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08901)|null|
|**2025-04-11**|**Hypergraph Vision Transformers: Images are More than Nodes, More than Edges**|<details><summary>Show Abstract</summary><p>Recent advancements in computer vision have highlighted the scalability of Vision Transformers (ViTs) across various tasks, yet challenges remain in balancing adaptability, computational efficiency, and the ability to model higher-order relationships. Vision Graph Neural Networks (ViGs) offer an alternative by leveraging graph-based methodologies but are hindered by the computational bottlenecks of clustering algorithms used for edge generation. To address these issues, we propose the Hypergraph Vision Transformer (HgVT), which incorporates a hierarchical bipartite hypergraph structure into the vision transformer framework to capture higher-order semantic relationships while maintaining computational efficiency. HgVT leverages population and diversity regularization for dynamic hypergraph construction without clustering, and expert edge pooling to enhance semantic extraction and facilitate graph-based image retrieval. Empirical results demonstrate that HgVT achieves strong performance on image classification and retrieval, positioning it as an efficient framework for semantic-based vision tasks.</p></details>|[2504.08710](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08710)|null|
|**2025-04-11**|**FocalLens: Instruction Tuning Enables Zero-Shot Conditional Image Representations**|<details><summary>Show Abstract</summary><p>Visual understanding is inherently contextual -- what we focus on in an image depends on the task at hand. For instance, given an image of a person holding a bouquet of flowers, we may focus on either the person such as their clothing, or the type of flowers, depending on the context of interest. Yet, most existing image encoding paradigms represent an image as a fixed, generic feature vector, overlooking the potential needs of prioritizing varying visual information for different downstream use cases. In this work, we introduce FocalLens, a conditional visual encoding method that produces different representations for the same image based on the context of interest, expressed flexibly through natural language. We leverage vision instruction tuning data and contrastively finetune a pretrained vision encoder to take natural language instructions as additional inputs for producing conditional image representations. Extensive experiments validate that conditional image representation from FocalLens better pronounce the visual features of interest compared to generic features produced by standard vision encoders like CLIP. In addition, we show FocalLens further leads to performance improvements on a range of downstream tasks including image-image retrieval, image classification, and image-text retrieval, with an average gain of 5 and 10 points on the challenging SugarCrepe and MMVP-VLM benchmarks, respectively.</p></details>|[2504.08368](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08368)|null|

Existing methods, including semantic graph approaches, often suffer from coarse geometric representations and lack temporal robustness against noise, dynamics, and viewpoint changes. We introduce PNE-SGAN, a Probabilistic NDT-Enhanced Semantic Graph Attention Network, to overcome these limitations. PNE-SGAN enhances semantic graphs by using Normal Distributions Transform (NDT) covariance matrices as rich, discriminative geometric node features, processed via a Graph Attention Network (GAT). Crucially, it integrates graph similarity scores into a probabilistic temporal filtering framework (modeled as an HMM/Bayes filter), incorporating uncertain odometry for motion modeling and utilizing forward-backward smoothing to effectively handle ambiguities. Evaluations on challenging KITTI sequences (00 and 08) demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, achieving Average Precision of 96.2\% and 95.1\%, respectively. PNE-SGAN significantly outperforms existing methods, particularly in difficult bidirectional loop scenarios where others falter. By synergizing detailed NDT geometry with principled probabilistic temporal reasoning, PNE-SGAN offers a highly accurate and robust solution for LiDAR LCD, enhancing SLAM reliability in complex, large-scale environments.</p></details>|[2504.08280](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08280)|null|
|**2025-04-10**|**Multi-modal Reference Learning for Fine-grained Text-to-Image Retrieval**|<details><summary>Show Abstract</summary><p>Fine-grained text-to-image retrieval aims to retrieve a fine-grained target image with a given text query. Existing methods typically assume that each training image is accurately depicted by its textual descriptions. However, textual descriptions can be ambiguous and fail to depict discriminative visual details in images, leading to inaccurate representation learning. To alleviate the effects of text ambiguity, we propose a Multi-Modal Reference learning framework to learn robust representations. We first propose a multi-modal reference construction module to aggregate all visual and textual details of the same object into a comprehensive multi-modal reference. The multi-modal reference hence facilitates the subsequent representation learning and retrieval similarity computation. Specifically, a reference-guided representation learning module is proposed to use multi-modal references to learn more accurate visual and textual representations. Additionally, we introduce a reference-based refinement method that employs the object references to compute a reference-based similarity that refines the initial retrieval results. Extensive experiments are conducted on five fine-grained text-to-image retrieval datasets for different text-to-image retrieval tasks. The proposed method has achieved superior performance over state-of-the-art methods. For instance, on the text-to-person image retrieval dataset RSTPReid, our method achieves the Rank1 accuracy of 56.2\%, surpassing the recent CFine by 5.6\%.</p></details>|[2504.07718](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07718)|null|
|**2025-04-09**|**A Pointcloud Registration Framework for Relocalization in Subterranean Environments**|<details><summary>Show Abstract</summary><p>Relocalization, the process of re-establishing a robot's position within an environment, is crucial for ensuring accurate navigation and task execution when external positioning information, such as GPS, is unavailable or has been lost. Subterranean environments present significant challenges for relocalization due to limited external positioning information, poor lighting that affects camera localization, irregular and often non-distinct surfaces, and dust, which can introduce noise and occlusion in sensor data. In this work, we propose a robust, computationally friendly framework for relocalization through point cloud registration utilizing a prior point cloud map. The framework employs Intrinsic Shape Signatures (ISS) to select feature points in both the target and prior point clouds. The Fast Point Feature Histogram (FPFH) algorithm is utilized to create descriptors for these feature points, and matching these descriptors yields correspondences between the point clouds. A 3D transformation is estimated using the matched points, which initializes a Normal Distribution Transform (NDT) registration. The transformation result from NDT is further refined using the Iterative Closest Point (ICP) registration algorithm. This framework enhances registration accuracy even in challenging conditions, such as dust interference and significant initial transformations between the target and source, making it suitable for autonomous robots operating in underground mines and tunnels. This framework was validated with experiments in simulated and real-world mine datasets, demonstrating its potential for improving relocalization.</p></details>|[2504.07231](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07231)|null|
|**2025-04-09**|**Patch Matters: Training-free Fine-grained Image Caption Enhancement via Local Perception**|<details><summary>Show Abstract</summary><p>High-quality image captions play a crucial role in improving the performance of cross-modal applications such as text-to-image generation, text-to-video generation, and text-image retrieval. To generate long-form, high-quality captions, many recent studies have employed multimodal large language models (MLLMs). However, current MLLMs often produce captions that lack fine-grained details or suffer from hallucinations, a challenge that persists in both open-source and closed-source models. Inspired by Feature-Integration theory, which suggests that attention must focus on specific regions to integrate visual information effectively, we propose a \textbf{divide-then-aggregate} strategy. Our method first divides the image into semantic and spatial patches to extract fine-grained details, enhancing the model's local perception of the image. These local details are then hierarchically aggregated to generate a comprehensive global description. To address hallucinations and inconsistencies in the generated captions, we apply a semantic-level filtering process during hierarchical aggregation. This training-free pipeline can be applied to both open-source models (LLaVA-1.5, LLaVA-1.6, Mini-Gemini) and closed-source models (Claude-3.5-Sonnet, GPT-4o, GLM-4V-Plus). Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method generates more detailed, reliable captions, advancing multimodal description generation without requiring model retraining.

|**2025-04-06**|**NCL-CIR: Noise-aware Contrastive Learning for Composed Image Retrieval**|<details><summary>Show Abstract</summary><p>Composed Image Retrieval (CIR) seeks to find a target image using a multi-modal query, which combines an image with modification text to pinpoint the target. While recent CIR methods have shown promise, they mainly focus on exploring relationships between the query pairs (image and text) through data augmentation or model design. These methods often assume perfect alignment between queries and target images, an idealized scenario rarely encountered in practice. In reality, pairs are often partially or completely mismatched due to issues like inaccurate modification texts, low-quality target images, and annotation errors. Ignoring these mismatches leads to numerous False Positive Pair (FFPs) denoted as noise pairs in the dataset, causing the model to overfit and ultimately reducing its performance. To address this problem, we propose the Noise-aware Contrastive Learning for CIR (NCL-CIR), comprising two key components: the Weight Compensation Block (WCB) and the Noise-pair Filter Block (NFB). The WCB coupled with diverse weight maps can ensure more stable token representations of multi-modal queries and target images. Meanwhile, the NFB, in conjunction with the Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) predicts noise pairs by evaluating loss distributions, and generates soft labels correspondingly, allowing for the design of the soft-label based Noise Contrastive Estimation (NCE) loss function. Consequently, the overall architecture helps to mitigate the influence of mismatched and partially matched samples, with experimental results demonstrating that NCL-CIR achieves exceptional performance on the benchmark datasets.</p></details>|[2504.04339](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04339)|null|

This paper presents REJEPA (Retrieval with Joint-Embedding Predictive Architecture), an innovative self-supervised framework designed for unimodal RS-CBIR. REJEPA utilises spatially distributed context token encoding to forecast abstract representations of target tokens, effectively capturing high-level semantic features and eliminating unnecessary pixel-level details. In contrast to generative methods that focus on pixel reconstruction or contrastive techniques that depend on negative pairs, REJEPA functions within feature space, achieving a reduction in computational complexity of 40-60% when compared to pixel-reconstruction baselines like Masked Autoencoders (MAE). To guarantee strong and varied representations, REJEPA incorporates Variance-Invariance-Covariance Regularisation (VICReg), which prevents encoder collapse by promoting feature diversity and reducing redundancy. The method demonstrates an estimated enhancement in retrieval accuracy of 5.1% on BEN-14K (S1), 7.4% on BEN-14K (S2), 6.0% on FMoW-RGB, and 10.1% on FMoW-Sentinel compared to prominent SSL techniques, including CSMAE-SESD, Mask-VLM, SatMAE, ScaleMAE, and SatMAE++, on extensive RS benchmarks BEN-14K (multispectral and SAR data), FMoW-RGB and FMoW-Sentinel.

In this work, we revisit temporal search paradigms for long-form video understanding and address a fundamental issue pertaining to all state-of-the-art (SOTA) long-context vision-language models (VLMs). Our contributions are twofold: First, we frame temporal search as a Long Video Haystack problem: finding a minimal set of relevant frames (e.g., one to five) from tens of thousands based on specific queries. Upon this formulation, we introduce LV-Haystack, the first dataset with 480 hours of videos, 15,092 human-annotated instances for both training and evaluation aiming to improve temporal search quality and efficiency. Results on LV-Haystack highlight a significant research gap in temporal search capabilities, with current SOTA search methods only achieving 2.1% temporal F1 score on the Longvideobench subset. Next, inspired by visual search in images, we propose a lightweight temporal search framework, T* that reframes costly temporal search as spatial search. T* leverages powerful visual localization techniques commonly used in images and introduces an adaptive zooming-in mechanism that operates across both temporal and spatial dimensions. Extensive experiments show that integrating T* with existing methods significantly improves SOTA long-form video understanding. Under an inference budget of 32 frames, T* improves GPT-4o's performance from 50.5% to 53.1% and LLaVA-OneVision-OV-72B's performance from 56.5% to 62.4% on the Longvideobench XL subset.

Especially when HD maps are used, a precise and repeatable method has to be chosen. Therefore accurate map generation but also re-localization against these maps is necessary. Due to best 3D reconstruction of the surrounding, LiDAR has become a reliable modality for localization. The latest LiDAR odometry estimation are based on iterative closest point (ICP) approaches, namely KISS-ICP and SAGE-ICP. We extend the capabilities of KISS-ICP by incorporating semantic information into the point alignment process using a generalizable approach with minimal parameter tuning. This enhancement allows us to surpass KISS-ICP in terms of absolute trajectory error (ATE), the primary metric for map accuracy. Additionally, we improve the Cartographer mapping framework to handle semantic information. Cartographer facilitates loop closure detection over larger areas, mitigating odometry drift and further enhancing ATE accuracy. By integrating semantic information into the mapping process, we enable the filtering of specific classes, such as parked vehicles, from the resulting map. This filtering improves relocalization quality by addressing temporal changes, such as vehicles being moved.</p></details>|[2504.02086](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02086)|null|

In real-world image retrieval scenarios, both query and database images often exhibit complexity, with multiple objects and intricate backgrounds. Users often want to retrieve images with specific object, which we define as the Focus-Oriented Image Retrieval (FOIR) task. While a standard image encoder can be employed to extract image features for similarity matching, it may not perform optimally in the multi-object-based FOIR task. This is because each image is represented by a single global feature vector. To overcome this, a prompt-based image retrieval solution is required. We propose an approach called Prompt-guided attention Head Selection (PHS) to leverage the head-wise potential of the multi-head attention mechanism in ViT in a promptable manner. PHS selects specific attention heads by matching their attention maps with user's visual prompts, such as a point, box, or segmentation. This empowers the model to focus on specific object of interest while preserving the surrounding visual context. Notably, PHS does not necessitate model re-training and avoids any image alteration. Experimental results show that PHS substantially improves performance on multiple datasets, offering a practical and training-free solution to enhance model performance in the FOIR task.</p></details>|[2504.01348](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01348)|null|

However, current multimodal retrieval tasks lack sufficient complexity and demonstrate limited practical application value. It spires us to design Instance-Driven Multimodal Image Retrieval (IDMR), a novel task that requires models to retrieve images containing the same instance as a query image while matching a text-described scenario.

Traditionally, models designed for CIR have relied on triplet data containing a reference image, reformulation text, and a target image. However, curating such triplet data often necessitates human intervention, leading to prohibitive costs. This challenge has hindered the scalability of CIR model training even with the availability of abundant unlabeled data. With the recent advances in foundational models, we advocate a shift in the CIR training paradigm where human annotations can be efficiently replaced by large language models (LLMs).

However, the theoretical foundations underlying CLIP's strong generalization remain unclear. In this work, we address this gap by proposing the Cross-modal Information Bottleneck (CIB) framework. CIB offers a principled interpretation of CLIP's contrastive learning objective as an implicit Information Bottleneck optimization. Under this view, the model maximizes shared cross-modal information while discarding modality-specific redundancies, thereby preserving essential semantic alignment across modalities. Building on this insight, we introduce a Cross-modal Information Bottleneck Regularization (CIBR) method that explicitly enforces these IB principles during training. CIBR introduces a penalty term to discourage modality-specific redundancy, thereby enhancing semantic alignment between image and text features. We validate CIBR on extensive vision-language benchmarks, including zero-shot classification across seven diverse image datasets and text-image retrieval on MSCOCO and Flickr30K. The results show consistent performance gains over standard CLIP. These findings provide the first theoretical understanding of CLIP's generalization through the IB lens. They also demonstrate practical improvements, offering guidance for future cross-modal representation learning.</p></details>|[2503.24182](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24182)|null|

We extract keypoints from the reference image and generate a 3D reference map with 3D reconstruction of the keypoints in advance. We emphasize that the more keypoints in the 3D reference map and the smaller the error of the 3D positions of the keypoints, the higher the accuracy of the camera pose estimation. However, previous image-only methods require a huge number of images, and it is difficult to 3D-reconstruct keypoints without error due to inevitable mismatches and failures in feature matching. As a result, the 3D reference map is sparse and inaccurate. In contrast, accurate 3D reference maps can be generated by combining images and 3D sensors. Recently, 3D-LiDAR has been widely used around the world. LiDAR, which measures a large space with high density, has become inexpensive. In addition, accurately calibrated cameras are also widely used, so images that record the external parameters of the camera without errors can be easily obtained. In this paper, we propose a method to directly assign 3D LiDAR point clouds to keypoints to generate dense and accurate 3D reference maps. The proposed method avoids feature matching and achieves accurate 3D reconstruction for almost all keypoints. To estimate camera pose over a wide area, we use the wide-area LiDAR point cloud to remove points that are not visible to the camera and reduce 2D-3D correspondence errors. Using indoor and outdoor datasets, we apply the proposed method to several state-of-the-art local features and confirm that it improves the accuracy of camera pose estimation.</p></details>|[2503.23664](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23664)|null|
|**2025-03-30**|**Multiview Image-Based Localization**|<details><summary>Show Abstract</summary><p>The image retrieval (IR) approach to image localization has distinct advantages to the 3D and the deep learning (DNN) approaches: it is seen-agnostic, simpler to implement and use, has no privacy issues, and is computationally efficient. The main drawback of this approach is relatively poor localization in both position and orientation of the query camera when compared to the competing approaches. This paper represents a hybrid approach that stores only image features in the database like some IR methods, but relies on a latent 3D reconstruction, like 3D methods but without retaining a 3D scene reconstruction. The approach is based on two ideas: {\em (i)} a novel proposal where query camera center estimation relies only on relative translation estimates but not relative rotation estimates through a decoupling of the two, and {\em (ii)} a shift from computing optimal pose from estimated relative pose to computing optimal pose from multiview correspondences, thus cutting out the ``middle-man''. Our approach shows improved performance on the 7-Scenes and Cambridge Landmarks datasets while also improving on timing and memory footprint as compared to state-of-the-art.</p></details>|[2503.23577](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23577)|null|
|**2025-03-27**|**LOCORE: Image Re-ranking with Long-Context Sequence Modeling**|<details><summary>Show Abstract</summary><p>We introduce LOCORE, Long-Context Re-ranker, a model that takes as input local descriptors corresponding to an image query and a list of gallery images and outputs similarity scores between the query and each gallery image. This model is used for image retrieval, where typically a first ranking is performed with an efficient similarity measure, and then a shortlist of top-ranked images is re-ranked based on a more fine-grained similarity measure. Compared to existing methods that perform pair-wise similarity estimation with local descriptors or list-wise re-ranking with global descriptors, LOCORE is the first method to perform list-wise re-ranking with local descriptors. To achieve this, we leverage efficient long-context sequence models to effectively capture the dependencies between query and gallery images at the local-descriptor level. During testing, we process long shortlists with a sliding window strategy that is tailored to overcome the context size limitations of sequence models. Our approach achieves superior performance compared with other re-rankers on established image retrieval benchmarks of landmarks (ROxf and RPar), products (SOP), fashion items (In-Shop), and bird species (CUB-200) while having comparable latency to the pair-wise local descriptor re-rankers.</p></details>|[2503.21772](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21772)|**[link](https://github.com/MrZilinXiao/LongContextReranker)**|
|**2025-03-27**|**Fwd2Bot: LVLM Visual Token Compression with Double Forward Bottleneck**|<details><summary>Show Abstract</summary><p>In this work, we aim to compress the vision tokens of a Large Vision Language Model (LVLM) into a representation that is simultaneously suitable for (a) generative and (b) discriminative tasks, (c) is nearly lossless, and (d) is storage-efficient. We propose a novel compression approach, called Fwd2Bot, that uses the LVLM itself to compress the visual information in a task-agnostic manner. At the core of Fwd2bot there exists a "double-forward pass" training strategy, whereby, during the first forward pass, the LLM (of the LVLM) creates a bottleneck by condensing the visual information into a small number of summary tokens. Then, using the same LLM, the second forward pass processes the language instruction(s) alongside the summary tokens, used as a direct replacement for the image ones. The training signal is provided by two losses: an autoregressive one applied after the second pass that provides a direct optimization objective for compression, and a contrastive loss, applied after the first pass, that further boosts the representation strength, especially for discriminative tasks. The training is further enhanced by stage-specific adapters. We accompany the proposed method by an in-depth ablation study. Overall, Fwd2Bot results in highly-informative compressed representations suitable for both generative and discriminative tasks. For generative tasks, we offer a 2x higher compression rate without compromising the generative capabilities, setting a new state-of-the-art result. For discriminative tasks, we set a new state-of-the-art on image retrieval and compositionality.</p></details>|[2503.21757](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21757)|null|

However, most existing VPR datasets are limited to single-viewpoint scenarios, leading to reduced recognition accuracy, particularly in multi-directional driving or feature-sparse scenes. Moreover, obtaining additional data to mitigate these limitations is often expensive. This paper introduces a novel training paradigm to improve the performance of existing VPR networks by enhancing multi-view diversity within current datasets through uncertainty estimation and NeRF-based data augmentation. Specifically, we initially train NeRF using the existing VPR dataset. Then, our devised self-supervised uncertainty estimation network identifies places with high uncertainty. The poses of these uncertain places are input into NeRF to generate new synthetic observations for further training of VPR networks. Additionally, we propose an improved storage method for efficient organization of augmented and original training data. We conducted extensive experiments on three datasets and tested three different VPR backbone networks. The results demonstrate that our proposed training paradigm significantly improves VPR performance by fully utilizing existing data, outperforming other training approaches. We further validated the effectiveness of our approach on self-recorded indoor and outdoor datasets, consistently demonstrating superior results. Our dataset and code have been released at \href{https://github.com/nubot-nudt/UGNA-VPR}{https://github.com/nubot-nudt/UGNA-VPR}.</p></details>|[2503.21338](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21338)|**[link](https://github.com/nubot-nudt/ugna-vpr)**|
|**2025-03-27**|**FineCIR: Explicit Parsing of Fine-Grained Modification Semantics for Composed Image Retrieval**|<details><summary>Show Abstract</summary><p>Composed Image Retrieval (CIR) facilitates image retrieval through a multimodal query consisting of a reference image and modification text. The reference image defines the retrieval context, while the modification text specifies desired alterations. However, existing CIR datasets predominantly employ coarse-grained modification text (CoarseMT), which inadequately captures fine-grained retrieval intents. This limitation introduces two key challenges: (1) ignoring detailed differences leads to imprecise positive samples, and (2) greater ambiguity arises when retrieving visually similar images. These issues degrade retrieval accuracy, necessitating manual result filtering or repeated queries. To address these limitations, we develop a robust fine-grained CIR data annotation pipeline that minimizes imprecise positive samples and enhances CIR systems' ability to discern modification intents accurately. Using this pipeline, we refine the FashionIQ and CIRR datasets to create two fine-grained CIR datasets: Fine-FashionIQ and Fine-CIRR. Furthermore, we introduce FineCIR, the first CIR framework explicitly designed to parse the modification text. FineCIR effectively captures fine-grained modification semantics and aligns them with ambiguous visual entities, enhancing retrieval precision. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FineCIR consistently outperforms state-of-the-art CIR baselines on both fine-grained and traditional CIR benchmark datasets. Our FineCIR code and fine-grained CIR datasets are available at https://github.com/SDU-L/FineCIR.git.</p></details>|[2503.21309](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21309)|**[link](https://github.com/sdu-l/finecir)**|
|**2025-03-27**|**Clean Image May be Dangerous: Data Poisoning Attacks Against Deep Hashing**|<details><summary>Show Abstract</summary><p>Large-scale image retrieval using deep hashing has become increasingly popular due to the exponential growth of image data and the remarkable feature extraction capabilities of deep neural networks (DNNs). However, deep hashing methods are vulnerable to malicious attacks, including adversarial and backdoor attacks. It is worth noting that these attacks typically involve altering the query images, which is not a practical concern in real-world scenarios. In this paper, we point out that even clean query images can be dangerous, inducing malicious target retrieval results, like undesired or illegal images. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to study data \textbf{p}oisoning \textbf{a}ttacks against \textbf{d}eep \textbf{hash}ing \textbf{(\textit{PADHASH})}. Specifically, we first train a surrogate model to simulate the behavior of the target deep hashing model. Then, a strict gradient matching strategy is proposed to generate the poisoned images. Extensive experiments on different models, datasets, hash methods, and hash code lengths demonstrate the effectiveness and generality of our attack method.</p></details>|[2503.21236](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21236)|null|
|**2025-03-25**|**CoLLM: A Large Language Model for Composed Image Retrieval**|<details><summary>Show Abstract</summary><p>Composed Image Retrieval (CIR) is a complex task that aims to retrieve images based on a multimodal query. Typical training data consists of triplets containing a reference image, a textual description of desired modifications, and the target image, which are expensive and time-consuming to acquire. The scarcity of CIR datasets has led to zero-shot approaches utilizing synthetic triplets or leveraging vision-language models (VLMs) with ubiquitous web-crawled image-caption pairs. However, these methods have significant limitations: synthetic triplets suffer from limited scale, lack of diversity, and unnatural modification text, while image-caption pairs hinder joint embedding learning of the multimodal query due to the absence of triplet data. Moreover, existing approaches struggle with complex and nuanced modification texts that demand sophisticated fusion and understanding of vision and language modalities. We present CoLLM, a one-stop framework that effectively addresses these limitations. Our approach generates triplets on-the-fly from image-caption pairs, enabling supervised training without manual annotation. We leverage Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate joint embeddings of reference images and modification texts, facilitating deeper multimodal fusion. Additionally, we introduce Multi-Text CIR (MTCIR), a large-scale dataset comprising 3.4M samples, and refine existing CIR benchmarks (CIRR and Fashion-IQ) to enhance evaluation reliability. Experimental results demonstrate that CoLLM achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple CIR benchmarks and settings. MTCIR yields competitive results, with up to 15% performance improvement. Our refined benchmarks provide more reliable evaluation metrics for CIR models, contributing to the advancement of this important field.</p></details>|[2503.19910](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19910)|**[link](https://github.com/hmchuong/CoLLM)**|
|**2025-03-25**|**Scene-agnostic Pose Regression for Visual Localization**|<details><summary>Show Abstract</summary><p>Absolute Pose Regression (APR) predicts 6D camera poses but lacks the adaptability to unknown environments without retraining, while Relative Pose Regression (RPR) generalizes better yet requires a large image retrieval database. Visual Odometry (VO) generalizes well in unseen environments but suffers from accumulated error in open trajectories. To address this dilemma, we introduce a new task, Scene-agnostic Pose Regression (SPR), which can achieve accurate pose regression in a flexible way while eliminating the need for retraining or databases. To benchmark SPR, we created a large-scale dataset, 360SPR, with over 200K photorealistic panoramas, 3.6M pinhole images and camera poses in 270 scenes at three different sensor heights. Furthermore, a SPR-Mamba model is initially proposed to address SPR in a dual-branch manner. Extensive experiments and studies demonstrate the effectiveness of our SPR paradigm, dataset, and model. In the unknown scenes of both 360SPR and 360Loc datasets, our method consistently outperforms APR, RPR and VO.

STDLoc is a full relocalization pipeline that can achieve accurate relocalization without relying on any pose prior. Unlike previous coarse-to-fine localization methods that require image retrieval first and then feature matching, we propose a novel sparse-to-dense localization paradigm. Based on this scene representation, we introduce a novel matching-oriented Gaussian sampling strategy and a scene-specific detector to achieve efficient and robust initial pose estimation. Furthermore, based on the initial localization results, we align the query feature map to the Gaussian feature field by dense feature matching to enable accurate localization. The experiments on indoor and outdoor datasets show that STDLoc outperforms current state-of-the-art localization methods in terms of localization accuracy and recall.</p></details>|[2503.19358](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19358)|null|
|**2025-03-25**|**Fine-grained Textual Inversion Network for Zero-Shot Composed Image Retrieval**|<details><summary>Show Abstract</summary><p>Composed Image Retrieval (CIR) allows users to search target images with a multimodal query, comprising a reference image and a modification text that describes the user's modification demand over the reference image. Nevertheless, due to the expensive labor cost of training data annotation, recent researchers have shifted to the challenging task of zero-shot CIR (ZS-CIR), which targets fulfilling CIR without annotated triplets. The pioneer ZS-CIR studies focus on converting the CIR task into a standard text-to-image retrieval task by pre-training a textual inversion network that can map a given image into a single pseudo-word token. Despite their significant progress, their coarse-grained textual inversion may be insufficient to capture the full content of the image accurately. To overcome this issue, in this work, we propose a novel Fine-grained Textual Inversion Network for ZS-CIR, named FTI4CIR. In particular, FTI4CIR comprises two main components: fine-grained pseudo-word token mapping and tri-wise caption-based semantic regularization. The former maps the image into a subject-oriented pseudo-word token and several attribute-oriented pseudo-word tokens to comprehensively express the image in the textual form, while the latter works on jointly aligning the fine-grained pseudo-word tokens to the real-word token embedding space based on a BLIP-generated image caption template. Extensive experiments conducted on three benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of our proposed method.</p></details>|[2503.19296](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19296)|**[link](https://github.com/ZiChao111/FTI4CIR)**|
|**2025-03-23**|**LocDiffusion: Identifying Locations on Earth by Diffusing in the Hilbert Space**|<details><summary>Show Abstract</summary><p>Image geolocalization is a fundamental yet challenging task, aiming at inferring the geolocation on Earth where an image is taken. Existing methods approach it either via grid-based classification or via image retrieval. Their performance significantly suffers when the spatial distribution of test images does not align with such choices. To address these limitations, we propose to leverage diffusion as a mechanism for image geolocalization. To avoid the problematic manifold reprojection step in diffusion, we developed a novel spherical positional encoding-decoding framework, which encodes points on a spherical surface (e.g., geolocations on Earth) into a Hilbert space of Spherical Harmonics coefficients and decodes points (geolocations) by mode-seeking. We call this type of position encoding Spherical Harmonics Dirac Delta (SHDD) Representation. We also propose a novel SirenNet-based architecture called CS-UNet to learn the conditional backward process in the latent SHDD space by minimizing a latent KL-divergence loss. We train a conditional latent diffusion model called LocDiffusion that generates geolocations under the guidance of images -- to the best of our knowledge, the first generative model for image geolocalization by diffusing geolocation information in a hidden location embedding space. We evaluate our method against SOTA image geolocalization baselines. LocDiffusion achieves competitive geolocalization performance and demonstrates significantly stronger generalizability to unseen geolocations.</p></details>|[2503.18142](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18142)|null|

Previous methods either treat the information equally or require the explicit storage of the entire context, tending to be laborious in real-world scenarios. Inspired by Mamba's inherent selectivity, we propose \textbf{CorrMamba}, a \textbf{Corr}espondence filter leveraging \textbf{Mamba}'s ability to selectively mine information from true correspondences while mitigating interference from false ones, thus achieving adaptive focus at a lower cost. To prevent Mamba from being potentially impacted by unordered keypoints that obscured its ability to mine spatial information, we customize a causal sequential learning approach based on the Gumbel-Softmax technique to establish causal dependencies between features in a fully autonomous and differentiable manner. Additionally, a local-context enhancement module is designed to capture critical contextual cues essential for correspondence pruning, complementing the core framework. Extensive experiments on relative pose estimation, visual localization, and analysis demonstrate that CorrMamba achieves state-of-the-art performance. Notably, in outdoor relative pose estimation, our method surpasses the previous SOTA by $2.58$ absolute percentage points in AUC@20\textdegree, highlighting its practical superiority.

Inspired by this, in this paper we explore the potential to learn time awareness from static images, trying to answer: what time tells us? To this end, we first introduce a Time-Oriented Collection (TOC) dataset, which contains 130,906 images with reliable timestamps. Leveraging this dataset, we propose a Time-Image Contrastive Learning (TICL) approach to jointly model timestamps and related visual representations through cross-modal contrastive learning. We found that the proposed TICL, 1) not only achieves state-of-the-art performance on the timestamp estimation task, over various benchmark metrics, 2) but also, interestingly, though only seeing static images, the time-aware embeddings learned from TICL show strong capability in several time-aware downstream tasks such as time-based image retrieval, video scene classification, and time-aware image editing.

The key challenge for ZS-CIR tasks is to modify a reference image according to manipulation text to accurately retrieve a target image, especially when the reference image is missing essential target content. In this paper, we propose a novel prediction-based mapping network, named PrediCIR, to adaptively predict the missing target visual content in reference images in the latent space before mapping for accurate ZS-CIR. Specifically, a world view generation module first constructs a source view by omitting certain visual content of a target view, coupled with an action that includes the manipulation intent derived from existing image-caption pairs. Then, a target content prediction module trains a world model as a predictor to adaptively predict the missing visual information guided by user intention in manipulating text at the latent space. The two modules map an image with the predicted relevant information to a pseudo-word token without extra supervision. Our model shows strong generalization ability on six ZS-CIR tasks. It obtains consistent and significant performance boosts ranging from 1.73% to 4.45% over the best methods and achieves new state-of-the-art results on ZS-CIR.

It is designed for indoor ground mobile robots that utilize laser Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM), ensuring process completeness and precise mapping results. For frontier search, the local-global sampling architecture based on multiple Rapidly Exploring Random Trees (RRTs) is employed. Traversability checks during RRT expansion and global RRT pruning upon map updates eliminate unreachable frontiers, reducing potential collisions and deadlocks. Adaptive sampling density adjustments, informed by obstacle distribution, enhance exploration coverage potential. For frontier point navigation, a stepwise consistent motion strategy is adopted, wherein the robot strictly drives straight on approximately equidistant line segments in the polyline path and rotates in place at segment junctions. This simplified, decoupled motion pattern improves scan-matching stability and mitigates map drift. For process control, the framework serializes frontier point selection and navigation, avoiding oscillation caused by frequent goal changes in conventional parallelized processes. The waypoint retracing mechanism is introduced to generate repeated observations, triggering loop closure detection and backend optimization in graph-based SLAM, thereby improving map consistency and precision. Experiments in both simulation and real-world scenarios validate the effectiveness of the framework. It achieves improved mapping coverage and precision in more challenging environments compared to baseline 2D exploration algorithms. It also shows robustness in supporting resource-constrained robot platforms and maintaining mapping consistency across various LiDAR field-of-view (FoV) configurations.</p></details>|[2503.17005](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17005)|null|

While state-of-the art methods that relies on feature matching have proven to be accurate for visual localization, its requirements for storage and compute are burdens. Scene coordinate regression (SCR) is an alternative approach that remove the barrier for storage by learning to map 2D pixels to 3D scene coordinates. Most popular SCR use Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to extract 2D descriptor, which we would argue that it miss the spatial relationship between pixels. Inspired by the success of vision transformer architecture, we present a new SCR architecture, called A-ScoRe, an Attention-based model which leverage attention on descriptor map level to produce meaningful and high-semantic 2D descriptors. Since the operation is performed on descriptor map, our model can work with multiple data modality whether it is a dense or sparse from depth-map, SLAM to Structure-from-Motion (SfM). This versatility allows A-SCoRe to operate in different kind of environments, conditions and achieve the level of flexibility that is important for mobile robots. Results show our methods achieve comparable performance with State-of-the-art methods on multiple benchmark while being light-weighted and much more flexible.

Existing studies have explored various fusion paradigms and consistency constraints to improve the alignment of equivalent entities, while overlooking that the visual modality may not always contribute positively. Empirically, entities with low-similarity images usually generate unsatisfactory performance, highlighting the limitation of overly relying on visual features. We believe the model can be biased toward the visual modality, leading to a shortcut image-matching task. To address this, we propose a counterfactual debiasing framework for MMEA, termed CDMEA, which investigates visual modality bias from a causal perspective. Our approach aims to leverage both visual and graph modalities to enhance MMEA while suppressing the direct causal effect of the visual modality on model predictions. By estimating the Total Effect (TE) of both modalities and excluding the Natural Direct Effect (NDE) of the visual modality, we ensure that the model predicts based on the Total Indirect Effect (TIE), effectively utilizing both modalities and reducing visual modality bias. Extensive experiments on 9 benchmark datasets show that CDMEA outperforms 14 state-of-the-art methods, especially in low-similarity, high-noise, and low-resource data scenarios.</p></details>|[2504.19458](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19458)|null|

By integrating the Atkinson-Shiffrin memory model's three-level architecture (sensory memory, working memory, and long-term memory), our system maintains continuous tracking of the femoral condyle throughout the surgical procedure, providing stable navigation support even in complex situations involving viewpoint changes, instrument occlusion, and tissue deformation. Unlike existing methods, our system operates in real-time on standard arthroscopic equipment without requiring additional tracking hardware, achieving 25.3 FPS with a latency of only 39.5 ms, representing a 3.5-fold improvement over our previous static system. For extended sequences (1000 frames), the dynamic system maintained an error of 5.3 plus-minus 1.5 pixels, compared to the static system's 12.6 plus-minus 3.7 pixels - an improvement of approximately 45 percent. For medium-length sequences (500 frames) and short sequences (100 frames), the system achieved approximately 35 percent and 19 percent accuracy improvements, respectively. Experimental results demonstrate the system overcomes limitations of traditional static matching methods, providing new technical support for improving surgical precision in ACL reconstruction.</p></details>|[2504.19398](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19398)|null|

This approach mitigates the significant viewpoint discrepancy between ground-view images and satellite map. The BEV image and satellite map are then projected into the road similarity space, where normalized cross correlation (NCC) is computed to assess the matching score.Finally, a particle filter is employed to estimate the probability distribution of the vehicle's pose.By comparing with GNSS ground truth, our localization system demonstrated stability without divergence over a long-distance test of 10 km, achieving an average lateral error of only 0.89 meters and an average planar Euclidean error of 3.41 meters. Furthermore, it maintained accurate and stable global localization even under nighttime conditions, further validating its robustness and adaptability.</p></details>|[2504.16346](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16346)|null|

While recent advancements in quantum computing offer promise for addressing NP-hard problems, existing quantum-based approaches for model fitting are either limited to a single model or consider multi-model scenarios within outlier-free datasets. This paper introduces a novel approach, the robust quantum multi-model fitting (R-QuMF) algorithm, designed to handle outliers effectively. Our method leverages the intrinsic capabilities of quantum hardware to tackle combinatorial challenges inherent in MMF tasks, and it does not require prior knowledge of the exact number of models, thereby enhancing its practical applicability. By formulating the problem as a maximum set coverage task for adiabatic quantum computers (AQC), R-QuMF outperforms existing quantum techniques, demonstrating superior performance across various synthetic and real-world 3D datasets. Our findings underscore the potential of quantum computing in addressing the complexities of MMF, especially in real-world scenarios with noisy and outlier-prone data.</p></details>|[2504.13836](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13836)|null|

The generated images often show significant errors with respect to the epipolar constraints that should be fulfilled, as given by the target pose. In this paper we address this issue by proposing a methodology to improve the geometric correctness of images generated by a diffusion model for single image NVS. We formulate a loss function based on image matching and epipolar constraints, and optimize the starting noise in a diffusion sampling process such that the generated image should both be a realistic image and fulfill geometric constraints derived from the given target pose. Our method does not require training data or fine-tuning of the diffusion models, and we show that we can apply it to multiple state-of-the-art models for single image NVS. The method is evaluated on the MegaScenes dataset and we show that geometric consistency is improved compared to the baseline models while retaining the quality of the generated images.</p></details>|[2504.08348](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08348)|null|

Using template image matching with differential evolution optimization, we identify the most similar 2D plane in 3D. The method is validated on a synthetic porous medium, achieving exact registration, and applied to Berea sandstone, where it achieves a structural similarity index (SSIM) of 0.990. With the registered images, we explore upscaling properties based on paired multimodal images, focusing on pore characteristics and effective elastic moduli. The thin-section image reveals 50 % more porosity and submicron pores than the registered CT plane. In addition, bulk and shear moduli from thin sections are 25 % and 30 % lower, respectively, than those derived from CT images. Beyond numerical comparisons, thin sections provide additional geological insights, including cementation, mineral phases, and weathering effects, which are not clear in CT images. This study demonstrates the potential of multimodal image registration to improve computed rock properties in digital rock physics by integrating complementary imaging modalities.</p></details>|[2504.06604](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06604)|**[link](https://github.com/jh-chung1/imgregister2dto3d)**|

Existing methods for extracting affine correspondences still have many limitations in terms of performance; thus, exploring a new paradigm is crucial. In this paper, we present a new pipeline designed for extracting accurate affine correspondences by integrating dense matching and geometric constraints. Specifically, a novel extraction framework is introduced, with the aid of dense matching and a novel keypoint scale and orientation estimator. For this purpose, we propose loss functions based on geometric constraints, which can effectively improve accuracy by supervising neural networks to learn feature geometry. The experimental show that the accuracy and robustness of our method outperform the existing ones in image matching tasks. To further demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, we applied it to relative pose estimation. Affine correspondences extracted by our method lead to more accurate poses than the baselines on a range of real-world datasets.

|**2025-04-01**|**Scaling Prompt Instructed Zero Shot Composed Image Retrieval with Image-Only Data**|<details><summary>Show Abstract</summary><p>Composed Image Retrieval (CIR) is the task of retrieving images matching a reference image augmented with a text, where the text describes changes to the reference image in natural language. Traditionally, models designed for CIR have relied on triplet data containing a reference image, reformulation text, and a target image. However, curating such triplet data often necessitates human intervention, leading to prohibitive costs. This challenge has hindered the scalability of CIR model training even with the availability of abundant unlabeled data. With the recent advances in foundational models, we advocate a shift in the CIR training paradigm where human annotations can be efficiently replaced by large language models (LLMs). Specifically, we demonstrate the capability of large captioning and language models in efficiently generating data for CIR only relying on unannotated image collections. Additionally, we introduce an embedding reformulation architecture that effectively combines image and text modalities. Our model, named InstructCIR, outperforms state-of-the-art methods in zero-shot composed image retrieval on CIRR and FashionIQ datasets. Furthermore, we demonstrate that by increasing the amount of generated data, our zero-shot model gets closer to the performance of supervised baselines.</p></details>|[2504.00812](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00812)|null|

Firstly, observing that modeling context interaction over the entire coarse feature map elicits highly redundant computation due to the neighboring representation similarity of tokens, a covisibility-guided token condenser is introduced to adaptively aggregate tokens in light of their covisibility scores that are dynamically estimated, thereby ensuring computational efficiency while improving the representational capacity of aggregated tokens simultaneously. Secondly, considering that feature interaction with massive non-covisible areas is distracting, which may degrade feature distinctiveness, a covisibility-assisted attention mechanism is deployed to selectively suppress irrelevant message broadcast from non-covisible reduced tokens, resulting in robust and compact attention to relevant rather than all ones. Thirdly, we find that at the fine-level stage, current methods adjust only the target view's keypoints to subpixel level, while those in the source view remain restricted at the coarse level and thus not informative enough, detrimental to keypoint location-sensitive usages. A simple yet potent fine correlation module is developed to refine the matching candidates in both source and target views to subpixel level, attaining attractive performance improvement. Thorough experimentation across an array of public benchmarks affirms CoMatch's promising accuracy, efficiency, and generalizability.</p></details>|[2503.23925](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23925)|null|

We propose a new explainability method (PAIR-X) that leverages both intermediate model activations and backpropagated relevance scores to generate fine-grained, highly-localized pairwise visual explanations. We use animal and building re-identification (re-ID) as a primary case study of our method, and we demonstrate qualitatively improved results over a diverse set of explainability baselines on 35 public re-ID datasets. In interviews, animal re-ID experts were in unanimous agreement that PAIR-X was an improvement over existing baselines for deep model explainability, and suggested that its visualizations would be directly applicable to their work. We also propose a novel quantitative evaluation metric for our method, and demonstrate that PAIR-X visualizations appear more plausible for correct image matches than incorrect ones even when the model similarity score for the pairs is the same. By improving interpretability, PAIR-X enables humans to better distinguish correct and incorrect matches.

In order to solve these problems, we propose a method based on Frequency-domain Information of Local Energy Response called FILER. The core of FILER is the local energy response model based on frequency-domain information, which can overcome the effect of nonlinear intensity differences. To improve the robustness to local nonlinear geometric distortions and noises, we design a new edge structure enhanced feature detector and convolutional feature weighted descriptor, respectively. In addition, FILER overcomes the sensitivity of the frequency-domain information to the rotation angle and achieves rotation invariance. Extensive experiments multimodal image pairs show that FILER outperforms other state-of-the-art algorithms and has good robustness and universality.</p></details>|[2503.20827](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20827)|null|

Traditional SLAM approaches struggle to balance efficiency and accuracy, particularly in large-scale settings where extensive computational resources are required for scene reconstruction and Bundle Adjustment (BA). However, this scene reconstruction, in the form of sparse pointclouds of visual landmarks, is often only used within the SLAM system because navigation and planning methods require different map representations. In this work, we therefore investigate a more scalable Visual SLAM (VSLAM) approach without reconstruction, mainly based on approaches for two-view loop closures. By restricting the map to a sparse keyframed pose graph without dense geometry representations, our '2GO' system achieves efficient optimization with competitive absolute trajectory accuracy. In particular, we find that recent advancements in image matching and monocular depth priors enable very accurate trajectory optimization from two-view edges. We conduct extensive experiments on diverse datasets, including large-scale scenarios, and provide a detailed analysis of the trade-offs between runtime, accuracy, and map size. Our results demonstrate that this streamlined approach supports real-time performance, scales well in map size and trajectory duration, and effectively broadens the capabilities of VSLAM for long-duration deployments to large environments.</p></details>|[2503.16275](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16275)|null|
|**2025-03-20**|**MapGlue: Multimodal Remote Sensing Image Matching**|<details><summary>Show Abstract</summary><p>Multimodal remote sensing image (MRSI) matching is pivotal for cross-modal fusion, localization, and object detection, but it faces severe challenges due to geometric, radiometric, and viewpoint discrepancies across imaging modalities. Existing unimodal datasets lack scale and diversity, limiting deep learning solutions. This paper proposes MapGlue, a universal MRSI matching framework, and MapData, a large-scale multimodal dataset addressing these gaps. Our contributions are twofold. MapData, a globally diverse dataset spanning 233 sampling points, offers original images (7,000x5,000 to 20,000x15,000 pixels). After rigorous cleaning, it provides 121,781 aligned electronic map-visible image pairs (512x512 pixels) with hybrid manual-automated ground truth, addressing the scarcity of scalable multimodal benchmarks. MapGlue integrates semantic context with a dual graph-guided mechanism to extract cross-modal invariant features. This structure enables global-to-local interaction, enhancing descriptor robustness against modality-specific distortions. Extensive evaluations on MapData and five public datasets demonstrate MapGlue's superiority in matching accuracy under complex conditions, outperforming state-of-the-art methods. Notably, MapGlue generalizes effectively to unseen modalities without retraining, highlighting its adaptability. This work addresses longstanding challenges in MRSI matching by combining scalable dataset construction with a robust, semantics-driven framework. Furthermore, MapGlue shows strong generalization capabilities on other modality matching tasks for which it was not specifically trained. The dataset and code are available at https://github.com/PeihaoWu/MapGlue.</p></details>|[2503.16185](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16185)|**[link](https://github.com/peihaowu/mapglue)**|
|**2025-03-19**|**PAPI-Reg: Patch-to-Pixel Solution for Efficient Cross-Modal Registration between LiDAR Point Cloud and Camera Image**|<details><summary>Show Abstract</summary><p>The primary requirement for cross-modal data fusion is the precise alignment of data from different sensors. However, the calibration between LiDAR point clouds and camera images is typically time-consuming and needs external calibration board or specific environmental features. Cross-modal registration effectively solves this problem by aligning the data directly without requiring external calibration. However, due to the domain gap between the point cloud and the image, existing methods rarely achieve satisfactory registration accuracy while maintaining real-time performance. To address this issue, we propose a framework that projects point clouds into several 2D representations for matching with camera images, which not only leverages the geometric characteristic of LiDAR point clouds more effectively but also bridge the domain gap between the point cloud and image. Moreover, to tackle the challenges of cross modal differences and the limited overlap between LiDAR point clouds and images in the image matching task, we introduce a multi-scale feature extraction network to effectively extract features from both camera images and the projection maps of LiDAR point cloud. Additionally, we propose a patch-to-pixel matching network to provide more effective supervision and achieve higher accuracy. We validate the performance of our model through experiments on the KITTI and nuScenes datasets. Our network achieves real-time performance and extremely high registration accuracy. On the KITTI dataset, our model achieves a registration accuracy rate of over 99\%.</p></details>|[2503.15285](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15285)|null|
|**2025-03-17**|**Less Biased Noise Scale Estimation for Threshold-Robust RANSAC**|<details><summary>Show Abstract</summary><p>The gold-standard for robustly estimating relative pose through image matching is RANSAC. While RANSAC is powerful, it requires setting the inlier threshold that determines whether the error of a correspondence under an estimated model is sufficiently small to be included in its consensus set. Setting this threshold is typically done by hand, and is difficult to tune without a access to ground truth data. Thus, a method capable of automatically determining the optimal threshold would be desirable. In this paper we revisit inlier noise scale estimation, which is an attractive approach as the inlier noise scale is linear to the optimal threshold. We revisit the noise scale estimation method SIMFIT and find bias in the estimate of the noise scale. In particular, we fix underestimates from using the same data for fitting the model as estimating the inlier noise, and from not taking the threshold itself into account. Secondly, since the optimal threshold within a scene is approximately constant we propose a multi-pair extension of SIMFIT++, by filtering of estimates, which improves results. Our approach yields robust performance across a range of thresholds, shown in Figure 1.</p></details>|[2503.13433](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13433)|null|

However, the existing datasets, learning frameworks, and evaluation metrics for the deep-learning based methods are limited to ground-based images recorded with pinhole cameras and have not been explored for satellite images. In this paper, we present ``SatDepth'', a novel dataset that provides dense ground-truth correspondences for training image matching frameworks meant specifically for satellite images. Satellites capture images from various viewing angles and tracks through multiple revisits over a region. To manage this variability, we propose a dataset balancing strategy through a novel image rotation augmentation procedure. This procedure allows for the discovery of corresponding pixels even in the presence of large rotational differences between the images. We benchmark four existing image matching frameworks using our dataset and carry out an ablation study that confirms that the models trained with our dataset with rotation augmentation outperform (up to 40% increase in precision) the models trained with other datasets, especially when there exist large rotational differences between the images.</p></details>|[2503.12706](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12706)|**[link](https://github.com/rahuldeshmukh43/satdepth)**|

Using this LCRT multiplier, we conduct numerical simulations on images. Notably, the LCRT multiplier significantly reduces the complexity of the algorithm. Based on these we introduce the new concept of the sharpness $R^{\rm E}_{\rm sc}$ of the edge strength and continuity of images associated with the LCRT and, using it, we propose a new LCRT image edge detection method (for short, LCRT-IED method) and provide its mathematical foundation. Our experiments indicate that this sharpness $R^{\rm E}_{\rm sc}$ characterizes the macroscopic trend of edge variations of the image under consideration, while this new LCRT-IED method not only controls the overall edge strength and continuity of the image, but also excels in feature extraction in some local regions. These highlight the fundamental differences between the LCRT and the Riesz transform, which are precisely due to the multiparameter of the former. This new LCRT-IED method might be of significant importance for image feature extraction, image matching, and image refinement.</p></details>|[2503.11148](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11148)|null|

MASt3R redefines image matching as a 3D task by leveraging DUSt3R and introducing a fast reciprocal matching scheme that accelerates matching by orders of magnitude while preserving theoretical guarantees. This approach has gained strong traction, with DUSt3R and MASt3R collectively cited over 250 times in a short span, underscoring their impact. However, despite its accuracy, MASt3R's inference speed remains a bottleneck. On an A40 GPU, latency per image pair is 198.16 ms, mainly due to computational overhead from the ViT encoder-decoder and Fast Reciprocal Nearest Neighbor (FastNN) matching.   To address this, we introduce Speedy MASt3R, a post-training optimization framework that enhances inference efficiency while maintaining accuracy. It integrates multiple optimization techniques, including FlashMatch-an approach leveraging FlashAttention v2 with tiling strategies for improved efficiency, computation graph optimization via layer and tensor fusion having kernel auto-tuning with TensorRT (GraphFusion), and a streamlined FastNN pipeline that reduces memory access time from quadratic to linear while accelerating block-wise correlation scoring through vectorized computation (FastNN-Lite). Additionally, it employs mixed-precision inference with FP16/FP32 hybrid computations (HybridCast), achieving speedup while preserving numerical precision. Evaluated on Aachen Day-Night, InLoc, 7-Scenes, ScanNet1500, and MegaDepth1500, Speedy MASt3R achieves a 54% reduction in inference time (198 ms to 91 ms per image pair) without sacrificing accuracy.

However, the small size of annotated fMRI datasets restricts its wide application. Meanwhile, structural MRIs (sMRIs), such as 3D T1-weighted (T1w) MRI, which are commonly used and readily accessible in clinical settings, are often overlooked. To integrate the complementary information from both function and structure for improved diagnostic accuracy, we propose CINP (Contrastive Image-Network Pre-training), a framework that employs contrastive learning between sMRI and FCN. During pre-training, we incorporate masked image modeling and network-image matching to enhance visual representation learning and modality alignment. Since the CINP facilitates knowledge transfer from FCN to sMRI, we introduce network prompting. It utilizes only sMRI from suspected patients and a small amount of FCNs from different patient classes for diagnosing mental disorders, which is practical in real-world clinical scenario. The competitive performance on three mental disorder diagnosis tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of the CINP in integrating multimodal MRI information, as well as the potential of incorporating sMRI into clinical diagnosis using network prompting.</p></details>|[2503.04205](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04205)|null|

This paper presents the first systematic study of backdoor threats in 3DGS pipelines. We identify that adversaries may implant backdoor views to induce malicious scene confusion during inference, potentially leading to environmental misperception in autonomous navigation or spatial distortion in immersive environments. To uncover this risk, we propose GuassTrap, a novel poisoning attack method targeting 3DGS models. GuassTrap injects malicious views at specific attack viewpoints while preserving high-quality rendering in non-target views, ensuring minimal detectability and maximizing potential harm. Specifically, the proposed method consists of a three-stage pipeline (attack, stabilization, and normal training) to implant stealthy, viewpoint-consistent poisoned renderings in 3DGS, jointly optimizing attack efficacy and perceptual realism to expose security risks in 3D rendering. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that GuassTrap can effectively embed imperceptible yet harmful backdoor views while maintaining high-quality rendering in normal views, validating its robustness, adaptability, and practical applicability.</p></details>|[2504.20829](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20829)|null|

Recent work on reconstructing the 3D human body using 3DGS attempts to leverage prior information on human pose to enhance rendering quality and improve training speed. However, it struggles to effectively fit dynamic surface planes due to multi-view inconsistency and redundant Gaussians. This inconsistency arises because Gaussian ellipsoids cannot accurately represent the surfaces of dynamic objects, which hinders the rapid reconstruction of the dynamic human body. Meanwhile, the prevalence of redundant Gaussians means that the training time of these works is still not ideal for quickly fitting a dynamic human body. To address these, we propose EfficientHuman, a model that quickly accomplishes the dynamic reconstruction of the human body using Articulated 2D Gaussian while ensuring high rendering quality. The key innovation involves encoding Gaussian splats as Articulated 2D Gaussian surfels in canonical space and then transforming them to pose space via Linear Blend Skinning (LBS) to achieve efficient pose transformations. Unlike 3D Gaussians, Articulated 2D Gaussian surfels can quickly conform to the dynamic human body while ensuring view-consistent geometries. Additionally, we introduce a pose calibration module and an LBS optimization module to achieve precise fitting of dynamic human poses, enhancing the model's performance. Extensive experiments on the ZJU-MoCap dataset demonstrate that EfficientHuman achieves rapid 3D dynamic human reconstruction in less than a minute on average, which is 20 seconds faster than the current state-of-the-art method, while also reducing the number of redundant Gaussians.</p></details>|[2504.20607](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20607)|null|

However, reliable camera pose estimation and scene reconstruction from such unconstrained videos remains an open challenge. Existing visual-only SLAM methods perform well on benchmark datasets but struggle with real-world footage which often exhibits uncontrolled motion including rapid rotations and pure forward movements, textureless regions, and dynamic objects. We analyze the limitations of current methods and introduce a robust pipeline designed to improve 3D reconstruction from casual videos. We build upon recent deep visual odometry methods but increase robustness in several ways. Camera intrinsics are automatically recovered from the first few frames using structure-from-motion. Dynamic objects and less-constrained areas are masked with a predictive model. Additionally, we leverage monocular depth estimates to regularize bundle adjustment, mitigating errors in low-parallax situations. Finally, we integrate place recognition and loop closure to reduce long-term drift and refine both intrinsics and pose estimates through global bundle adjustment. We demonstrate large-scale contiguous 3D models from several online videos in various environments. In contrast, baseline methods typically produce locally inconsistent results at several points, producing separate segments or distorted maps. In lieu of ground-truth pose data, we evaluate map consistency, execution time and visual accuracy of re-rendered NeRF models. Our proposed system establishes a new baseline for visual reconstruction from casual uncontrolled videos found online, demonstrating more consistent reconstructions over longer sequences of in-the-wild videos than previously achieved.</p></details>|[2504.20496](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20496)|null|
|**2025-04-29**|**Creating Your Editable 3D Photorealistic Avatar with Tetrahedron-constrained Gaussian Splatting**|<details><summary>Show Abstract</summary><p>Personalized 3D avatar editing holds significant promise due to its user-friendliness and availability to applications such as AR/VR and virtual try-ons. Previous studies have explored the feasibility of 3D editing, but often struggle to generate visually pleasing results, possibly due to the unstable representation learning under mixed optimization of geometry and texture in complicated reconstructed scenarios. In this paper, we aim to provide an accessible solution for ordinary users to create their editable 3D avatars with precise region localization, geometric adaptability, and photorealistic renderings. To tackle this challenge, we introduce a meticulously designed framework that decouples the editing process into local spatial adaptation and realistic appearance learning, utilizing a hybrid Tetrahedron-constrained Gaussian Splatting (TetGS) as the underlying representation. TetGS combines the controllable explicit structure of tetrahedral grids with the high-precision rendering capabilities of 3D Gaussian Splatting and is optimized in a progressive manner comprising three stages: 3D avatar instantiation from real-world monocular videos to provide accurate priors for TetGS initialization; localized spatial adaptation with explicitly partitioned tetrahedrons to guide the redistribution of Gaussian kernels; and geometry-based appearance generation with a coarse-to-fine activation strategy. Both qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our approach in generating photorealistic 3D editable avatars.</p></details>|[2504.20403](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20403)|null|

First, the method uses 3DGS to render a synthetic RGBD image at some initial pose estimate. Second, it establishes 2D-2D correspondences between the query image and this synthetic image. Third, it uses the depth map to lift the 2D-2D correspondences to 2D-3D correspondences and solves a perspective-n-point (PnP) problem to produce a final pose estimate. Results from evaluation across three existing datasets with 38 scenes and over 2,700 test images show that our method significantly reduces both inference time (by over two orders of magnitude, from more than 10 seconds to as fast as 0.1 seconds) and estimation error compared to baseline methods that use photometric loss minimization. Results also show that our method tolerates large errors in the initial pose estimate of up to 55{\deg} in rotation and 1.1 units in translation (normalized by scene scale), achieving final pose errors of less than 5{\deg} in rotation and 0.05 units in translation on 90% of images from the Synthetic NeRF and Mip-NeRF360 datasets and on 42% of images from the more challenging Tanks and Temples dataset.</p></details>|[2504.20379](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20379)|null|

Previous methods relying on dense views struggle with extremely sparse Structure-from-Motion points for initialization. While learning-based Multi-view Stereo (MVS) provides dense 3D points, directly combining it with Gaussian Splatting leads to suboptimal results due to the ill-posed nature of sparse-view geometric optimization. We propose Sparse2DGS, an MVS-initialized Gaussian Splatting pipeline for complete and accurate reconstruction. Our key insight is to incorporate the geometric-prioritized enhancement schemes, allowing for direct and robust geometric learning under ill-posed conditions. Sparse2DGS outperforms existing methods by notable margins while being ${2}\times$ faster than the NeRF-based fine-tuning approach.</p></details>|[2504.20378](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20378)|null|
|**2025-04-28**|**MP-SfM: Monocular Surface Priors for Robust Structure-from-Motion**|<details><summary>Show Abstract</summary><p>While Structure-from-Motion (SfM) has seen much progress over the years, state-of-the-art systems are prone to failure when facing extreme viewpoint changes in low-overlap, low-parallax or high-symmetry scenarios. Because capturing images that avoid these pitfalls is challenging, this severely limits the wider use of SfM, especially by non-expert users. We overcome these limitations by augmenting the classical SfM paradigm with monocular depth and normal priors inferred by deep neural networks. Thanks to a tight integration of monocular and multi-view constraints, our approach significantly outperforms existing ones under extreme viewpoint changes, while maintaining strong performance in standard conditions. We also show that monocular priors can help reject faulty associations due to symmetries, which is a long-standing problem for SfM. This makes our approach the first capable of reliably reconstructing challenging indoor environments from few images. Through principled uncertainty propagation, it is robust to errors in the priors, can handle priors inferred by different models with little tuning, and will thus easily benefit from future progress in monocular depth and normal estimation.

Our model builds upon the recent Large Reconstruction Models (LRMs) that achieve state-of-the-art sparse-view reconstruction quality. However, existing LRMs struggle to reconstruct unseen parts accurately and cannot recover glossy appearance or generate relightable 3D contents that can be consumed by standard Graphics engines. To address these limitations, we make three key technical contributions to build a more practical multi-view 3D reconstruction framework. First, we introduce an update model that allows us to progressively add more input views to improve our reconstruction. Second, we propose a hexa-plane neural SDF representation to better recover detailed textures, geometry and material parameters. Third, we develop a novel neural directional-embedding mechanism to handle view-dependent effects. Trained on a large-scale shape and material dataset with a tailored coarse-to-fine training scheme, our model achieves compelling results. It compares favorably to optimization-based dense-view inverse rendering methods in terms of geometry and relighting accuracy, while requiring only a fraction of the inference time.</p></details>|[2504.20026](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20026)|null|
|**2025-04-28**|**Mesh-Learner: Texturing Mesh with Spherical Harmonics**|<details><summary>Show Abstract</summary><p>In this paper, we present a 3D reconstruction and rendering framework termed Mesh-Learner that is natively compatible with traditional rasterization pipelines. It integrates mesh and spherical harmonic (SH) texture (i.e., texture filled with SH coefficients) into the learning process to learn each mesh s view-dependent radiance end-to-end. Images are rendered by interpolating surrounding SH Texels at each pixel s sampling point using a novel interpolation method. Conversely, gradients from each pixel are back-propagated to the related SH Texels in SH textures. Mesh-Learner exploits graphic features of rasterization pipeline (texture sampling, deferred rendering) to render, which makes Mesh-Learner naturally compatible with tools (e.g., Blender) and tasks (e.g., 3D reconstruction, scene rendering, reinforcement learning for robotics) that are based on rasterization pipelines. Our system can train vast, unlimited scenes because we transfer only the SH textures within the frustum to the GPU for training. At other times, the SH textures are stored in CPU RAM, which results in moderate GPU memory usage. The rendering results on interpolation and extrapolation sequences in the Replica and FAST-LIVO2 datasets achieve state-of-the-art performance compared to existing state-of-the-art methods (e.g., 3D Gaussian Splatting and M2-Mapping).

Traditional structured light techniques rely on inherent point-to-point triangulation, which limits accurate 3D measurements in these challenging scenarios. Parallel single-pixel imaging (PSI) has demonstrated unprecedented superiority under extreme conditions and has emerged as a promising approach of accurate 3D measurements. However, a complete theoretical model has not been reported in existing work to well explain its underlying mechanisms and quantitatively characterize its performance. In this study, a comprehensive theoretical model for the PSI method is proposed, including imaging and noise models. The proposed imaging model describes light transport coefficients under complex illumination, elucidating the intrinsic mechanisms of successful 3D imaging using PSI. The developed noise model quantitatively analyzes the impact of environmental noise on measurement accuracy, offering a framework to guide the error analysis of a PSI system. Numerical simulations and experimental results validate the proposed models, revealing the generality and robustness of PSI. Finally, potential research directions are highlighted to guide and inspire future investigations. The established theoretical models lay a solid foundation of PSI and brings new insights and opportunities for future application in more demanding 3D reconstruction tasks.</p></details>|[2504.19923](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19923)|null|

However, most works rely on low dynamic range (LDR) images, which limits the capturing of richer scene details. Some prior works have focused on high dynamic range (HDR) scene reconstruction, typically require capturing of multi-view sharp images with different exposure times at fixed camera positions during exposure times, which is time-consuming and challenging in practice. For a more flexible data acquisition, we propose a one-stage method: \textbf{CasualHDRSplat} to easily and robustly reconstruct the 3D HDR scene from casually captured videos with auto-exposure enabled, even in the presence of severe motion blur and varying unknown exposure time. \textbf{CasualHDRSplat} contains a unified differentiable physical imaging model which first applies continuous-time trajectory constraint to imaging process so that we can jointly optimize exposure time, camera response function (CRF), camera poses, and sharp 3D HDR scene. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing methods in terms of robustness and rendering quality.

While deep learning approaches have significantly improved performance, they often incur substantial computational costs, limiting their deployment in real-time edge applications. Efforts to create lightweight neural networks have seen some success, yet they often result in trade-offs between efficiency and accuracy. Additionally, the high-dimensional descriptors generated by these networks poses challenges for distributed applications requiring efficient communication and coordination, highlighting the need for compact yet competitively accurate descriptors. In this paper, we present EdgePoint2, a series of lightweight keypoint detection and description neural networks specifically tailored for edge computing applications on embedded system. The network architecture is optimized for efficiency without sacrificing accuracy. To train compact descriptors, we introduce a combination of Orthogonal Procrustes loss and similarity loss, which can serve as a general approach for hypersphere embedding distillation tasks. Additionally, we offer 14 sub-models to satisfy diverse application requirements. Our experiments demonstrate that EdgePoint2 consistently achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) accuracy and efficiency across various challenging scenarios while employing lower-dimensional descriptors (32/48/64). Beyond its accuracy, EdgePoint2 offers significant advantages in flexibility, robustness, and versatility. Consequently, EdgePoint2 emerges as a highly competitive option for visual tasks, especially in contexts demanding adaptability to diverse computational and communication constraints.</p></details>|[2504.17280](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17280)|null|

We focus on 2D range images~(RIs) as a lightweight format for representing 3D LiDAR observations. Although conventional image compression techniques can be adapted to improve compression efficiency for RIs, their practical performance is expected to be limited due to differences in bit precision and the distinct pixel value distribution characteristics between natural images and RIs. We propose a novel implicit neural representation~(INR)--based RI compression method that effectively handles floating-point valued pixels. The proposed method divides RIs into depth and mask images and compresses them using patch-wise and pixel-wise INR architectures with model pruning and quantization, respectively. Experiments on the KITTI dataset show that the proposed method outperforms existing image, point cloud, RI, and INR-based compression methods in terms of 3D reconstruction and detection quality at low bitrates and decoding latency.</p></details>|[2504.17229](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17229)|null|

We utilize recent advancements in 3D reconstruction based on Gaussian Splatting for 3D object placement in driving scenes. Unlike existing diffusion-based methods that synthesize images conditioned on BEV layouts, our approach places 3D objects directly in the reconstructed 3D space with explicitly imposed geometric transformations. This ensures both the physical plausibility of object placement and highly accurate 3D pose and position annotations.   Our experiments demonstrate that even by integrating a limited number of external 3D objects into real scenes, the augmented data significantly enhances 3D object detection performance and outperforms existing diffusion-based 3D augmentation for object detection. Extensive testing on the nuScenes dataset reveals that imposing high geometric diversity in object placement has a greater impact compared to the appearance diversity of objects. Additionally, we show that generating hard examples, either by maximizing detection loss or imposing high visual occlusion in camera images, does not lead to more efficient 3D data augmentation for camera-based 3D object detection in autonomous driving.</p></details>|[2504.16740](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16740)|null|

To achieve robust policy learning and generalization, we opt to learn a world model of the 3D rigid body dynamics involved in non-prehensile manipulations and use it for model-based reinforcement learning. We propose PIN-WM, a Physics-INformed World Model that enables efficient end-to-end identification of a 3D rigid body dynamical system from visual observations. Adopting differentiable physics simulation, PIN-WM can be learned with only few-shot and task-agnostic physical interaction trajectories. Further, PIN-WM is learned with observational loss induced by Gaussian Splatting without needing state estimation. To bridge Sim2Real gaps, we turn the learned PIN-WM into a group of Digital Cousins via physics-aware randomizations which perturb physics and rendering parameters to generate diverse and meaningful variations of the PIN-WM. Extensive evaluations on both simulation and real-world tests demonstrate that PIN-WM, enhanced with physics-aware digital cousins, facilitates learning robust non-prehensile manipulation skills with Sim2Real transfer, surpassing the Real2Sim2Real state-of-the-arts.</p></details>|[2504.16693](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16693)|null|

Without refocusing, the camera will automatically focus on the fixed object for all views, and current NeRF methods typically using one camera fail due to the consistent defocus blur and a lack of sharp reference. To restore the all-in-focus NeRF, we introduce the dual-camera from smartphones, where the ultra-wide camera has a wider depth-of-field (DoF) and the main camera possesses a higher resolution. The dual camera pair saves the high-fidelity details from the main camera and uses the ultra-wide camera's deep DoF as reference for all-in-focus restoration. To this end, we first implement spatial warping and color matching to align the dual camera, followed by a defocus-aware fusion module with learnable defocus parameters to predict a defocus map and fuse the aligned camera pair. We also build a multi-view dataset that includes image pairs of the main and ultra-wide cameras in a smartphone. Extensive experiments on this dataset verify that our solution, termed DC-NeRF, can produce high-quality all-in-focus novel views and compares favorably against strong baselines quantitatively and qualitatively. We further show DoF applications of DC-NeRF with adjustable blur intensity and focal plane, including refocusing and split diopter.</p></details>|[2504.16636](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16636)|null|

Our method integrates instance segmentation with generative inpainting to remove identifiable entities while preserving scene integrity. Extensive evaluations on 2D COCO-based object detection show that ROAR achieves 87.5% of the baseline detection average precision (AP), whereas image dropping achieves only 74.2% of the baseline AP, highlighting the advantage of scrubbing in preserving dataset utility. The degradation is even more severe for small objects due to occlusion and loss of fine-grained details.

Existing approaches address these issues by augmenting image observations in RGB space or employing Real-to-Sim-to-Real pipelines based on physical simulators. However, the former is constrained to 2D data augmentation, while the latter suffers from imprecise physical simulation caused by inaccurate geometric reconstruction. This paper introduces RoboSplat, a novel method that generates diverse, visually realistic demonstrations by directly manipulating 3D Gaussians. Specifically, we reconstruct the scene through 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), directly edit the reconstructed scene, and augment data across six types of generalization with five techniques: 3D Gaussian replacement for varying object types, scene appearance, and robot embodiments; equivariant transformations for different object poses; visual attribute editing for various lighting conditions; novel view synthesis for new camera perspectives; and 3D content generation for diverse object types. Comprehensive real-world experiments demonstrate that RoboSplat significantly enhances the generalization of visuomotor policies under diverse disturbances. Notably, while policies trained on hundreds of real-world demonstrations with additional 2D data augmentation achieve an average success rate of 57.2%, RoboSplat attains 87.8% in one-shot settings across six types of generalization in the real world.</p></details>|[2504.13175](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13175)|null|

While recent advances in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have enabled fast and high-quality scene reconstruction, research has also explored incorporating open-vocabulary understanding into 3DGS. However, most existing methods require iterative optimization over per-view 2D semantic feature maps, which not only results in inefficiencies but also leads to inconsistent 3D semantics across views. To address these limitations, we introduce a training-free framework that constructs a superpoint graph directly from Gaussian primitives. The superpoint graph partitions the scene into spatially compact and semantically coherent regions, forming view-consistent 3D entities and providing a structured foundation for open-vocabulary understanding. Based on the graph structure, we design an efficient reprojection strategy that lifts 2D semantic features onto the superpoints, avoiding costly multi-view iterative training. The resulting representation ensures strong 3D semantic coherence and naturally supports hierarchical understanding, enabling both coarse- and fine-grained open-vocabulary perception within a unified semantic field. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art open-vocabulary segmentation performance, with semantic field reconstruction completed over $30\times$ faster.

We propose St4RTrack, a feed-forward framework that simultaneously reconstructs and tracks dynamic video content in a world coordinate frame from RGB inputs. This is achieved by predicting two appropriately defined pointmaps for a pair of frames captured at different moments. Specifically, we predict both pointmaps at the same moment, in the same world, capturing both static and dynamic scene geometry while maintaining 3D correspondences. Chaining these predictions through the video sequence with respect to a reference frame naturally computes long-range correspondences, effectively combining 3D reconstruction with 3D tracking. Unlike prior methods that rely heavily on 4D ground truth supervision, we employ a novel adaptation scheme based on a reprojection loss.

To enable future photorealistic 3D immersive visual communication applications, significant compression is essential for transmission over the existing Internet infrastructure. Hence, we propose Compressed Gaussian Splatting (CompGS++), a novel framework that leverages compact Gaussian primitives to achieve accurate 3D modeling with substantial size reduction for both static and dynamic scenes. Our design is based on the principle of eliminating redundancy both between and within primitives. Specifically, we develop a comprehensive prediction paradigm to address inter-primitive redundancy through spatial and temporal primitive prediction modules. The spatial primitive prediction module establishes predictive relationships for scene primitives and enables most primitives to be encoded as compact residuals, substantially reducing the spatial redundancy. We further devise a temporal primitive prediction module to handle dynamic scenes, which exploits primitive correlations across timestamps to effectively reduce temporal redundancy. Moreover, we devise a rate-constrained optimization module that jointly minimizes reconstruction error and rate consumption. This module effectively eliminates parameter redundancy within primitives and enhances the overall compactness of scene representations. Comprehensive evaluations across multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that CompGS++ significantly outperforms existing methods, achieving superior compression performance while preserving accurate scene modeling.

|**2025-04-17**|**Second-order Optimization of Gaussian Splats with Importance Sampling**|<details><summary>Show Abstract</summary><p>3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) is widely used for novel view synthesis due to its high rendering quality and fast inference time. However, 3DGS predominantly relies on first-order optimizers such as Adam, which leads to long training times. To address this limitation, we propose a novel second-order optimization strategy based on Levenberg-Marquardt (LM) and Conjugate Gradient (CG), which we specifically tailor towards Gaussian Splatting. Our key insight is that the Jacobian in 3DGS exhibits significant sparsity since each Gaussian affects only a limited number of pixels. We exploit this sparsity by proposing a matrix-free and GPU-parallelized LM optimization. To further improve its efficiency, we propose sampling strategies for both the camera views and loss function and, consequently, the normal equation, significantly reducing the computational complexity. In addition, we increase the convergence rate of the second-order approximation by introducing an effective heuristic to determine the learning rate that avoids the expensive computation cost of line search methods. As a result, our method achieves a $3\times$ speedup over standard LM and outperforms Adam by $~6\times$ when the Gaussian count is low while remaining competitive for moderate counts.

We argue that incorporating full 3D evaluation of Gaussians throughout the 3DGS pipeline can effectively address these issues while preserving rasterization efficiency. Specifically, we introduce an adaptive 3D smoothing filter to mitigate aliasing and present a stable view-space bounding method that eliminates popping artifacts when Gaussians extend beyond the view frustum. Furthermore, we promote tile-based culling to 3D with screen-space planes, accelerating rendering and reducing sorting costs for hierarchical rasterization. Our method achieves state-of-the-art quality on in-distribution evaluation sets and significantly outperforms other approaches for out-of-distribution views. Our qualitative evaluations further demonstrate the effective removal of aliasing, distortions, and popping artifacts, ensuring real-time, artifact-free rendering.</p></details>|[2504.12811](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12811)|null|
|**2025-04-17**|**CAGE-GS: High-fidelity Cage Based 3D Gaussian Splatting Deformation**|<details><summary>Show Abstract</summary><p>As 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) gains popularity as a 3D representation of real scenes, enabling user-friendly deformation to create novel scenes while preserving fine details from the original 3DGS has attracted significant research attention. We introduce CAGE-GS, a cage-based 3DGS deformation method that seamlessly aligns a source 3DGS scene with a user-defined target shape. Our approach learns a deformation cage from the target, which guides the geometric transformation of the source scene. While the cages effectively control structural alignment, preserving the textural appearance of 3DGS remains challenging due to the complexity of covariance parameters. To address this, we employ a Jacobian matrix-based strategy to update the covariance parameters of each Gaussian, ensuring texture fidelity post-deformation. Our method is highly flexible, accommodating various target shape representations, including texts, images, point clouds, meshes and 3DGS models. Extensive experiments and ablation studies on both public datasets and newly proposed scenes demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing techniques in both efficiency and deformation quality.</p></details>|[2504.12800](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12800)|null|
|**2025-04-14**|**DNF-Avatar: Distilling Neural Fields for Real-time Animatable Avatar Relighting**|<details><summary>Show Abstract</summary><p>Creating relightable and animatable human avatars from monocular videos is a rising research topic with a range of applications, e.g. virtual reality, sports, and video games. Previous works utilize neural fields together with physically based rendering (PBR), to estimate geometry and disentangle appearance properties of human avatars. However, one drawback of these methods is the slow rendering speed due to the expensive Monte Carlo ray tracing. To tackle this problem, we proposed to distill the knowledge from implicit neural fields (teacher) to explicit 2D Gaussian splatting (student) representation to take advantage of the fast rasterization property of Gaussian splatting. To avoid ray-tracing, we employ the split-sum approximation for PBR appearance. We also propose novel part-wise ambient occlusion probes for shadow computation. Shadow prediction is achieved by querying these probes only once per pixel, which paves the way for real-time relighting of avatars. These techniques combined give high-quality relighting results with realistic shadow effects. Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed student model achieves comparable or even better relighting results with our teacher model while being 370 times faster at inference time, achieving a 67 FPS rendering speed.</p></details>|[2504.10486](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10486)|null|

While recent NeRF-based approaches have shown promising results, most suffer from high computational costs, and some rely on carefully captured or pre-processed data--such as RAW sensor inputs or multi-exposure sequences--which severely limits their practicality. In contrast, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) enables real-time rendering with competitive visual fidelity; however, existing 3DGS-based methods struggle with low-light sRGB inputs, resulting in unstable Gaussian initialization and ineffective noise suppression. To address these challenges, we propose LL-Gaussian, a novel framework for 3D reconstruction and enhancement from low-light sRGB images, enabling pseudo normal-light novel view synthesis. Our method introduces three key innovations: 1) an end-to-end Low-Light Gaussian Initialization Module (LLGIM) that leverages dense priors from learning-based MVS approach to generate high-quality initial point clouds; 2) a dual-branch Gaussian decomposition model that disentangles intrinsic scene properties (reflectance and illumination) from transient interference, enabling stable and interpretable optimization; 3) an unsupervised optimization strategy guided by both physical constrains and diffusion prior to jointly steer decomposition and enhancement. Additionally, we contribute a challenging dataset collected in extreme low-light environments and demonstrate the effectiveness of LL-Gaussian. Compared to state-of-the-art NeRF-based methods, LL-Gaussian achieves up to 2,000 times faster inference and reduces training time to just 2%, while delivering superior reconstruction and rendering quality.</p></details>|[2504.10331](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10331)|null|
|**2025-04-14**|**ESCT3D: Efficient and Selectively Controllable Text-Driven 3D Content Generation with Gaussian Splatting**|<details><summary>Show Abstract</summary><p>In recent years, significant advancements have been made in text-driven 3D content generation. However, several challenges remain. In practical applications, users often provide extremely simple text inputs while expecting high-quality 3D content. Generating optimal results from such minimal text is a difficult task due to the strong dependency of text-to-3D models on the quality of input prompts. Moreover, the generation process exhibits high variability, making it difficult to control. Consequently, multiple iterations are typically required to produce content that meets user expectations, reducing generation efficiency. To address this issue, we propose GPT-4V for self-optimization, which significantly enhances the efficiency of generating satisfactory content in a single attempt. Furthermore, the controllability of text-to-3D generation methods has not been fully explored. Our approach enables users to not only provide textual descriptions but also specify additional conditions, such as style, edges, scribbles, poses, or combinations of multiple conditions, allowing for more precise control over the generated 3D content. Additionally, during training, we effectively integrate multi-view information, including multi-view depth, masks, features, and images, to address the common Janus problem in 3D content generation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves robust generalization, facilitating the efficient and controllable generation of high-quality 3D content.</p></details>|[2504.10316](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10316)|null|
|**2025-04-14**|**TT3D: Table Tennis 3D Reconstruction**|<details><summary>Show Abstract</summary><p>Sports analysis requires processing large amounts of data, which is time-consuming and costly. Advancements in neural networks have significantly alleviated this burden, enabling highly accurate ball tracking in sports broadcasts. However, relying solely on 2D ball tracking is limiting, as it depends on the camera's viewpoint and falls short of supporting comprehensive game analysis. To address this limitation, we propose a novel approach for reconstructing precise 3D ball trajectories from online table tennis match recordings. Our method leverages the underlying physics of the ball's motion to identify the bounce state that minimizes the reprojection error of the ball's flying trajectory, hence ensuring an accurate and reliable 3D reconstruction. A key advantage of our approach is its ability to infer ball spin without relying on human pose estimation or racket tracking, which are often unreliable or unavailable in broadcast footage. We developed an automated camera calibration method capable of reliably tracking camera movements. Additionally, we adapted an existing 3D pose estimation model, which lacks depth motion capture, to accurately track player movements. Together, these contributions enable the full 3D reconstruction of a table tennis rally.</p></details>|[2504.10035](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10035)|null|
|**2025-04-14**|**EBAD-Gaussian: Event-driven Bundle Adjusted Deblur Gaussian Splatting**|<details><summary>Show Abstract</summary><p>While 3D Gaussian Splatting (3D-GS) achieves photorealistic novel view synthesis, its performance degrades with motion blur. In scenarios with rapid motion or low-light conditions, existing RGB-based deblurring methods struggle to model camera pose and radiance changes during exposure, reducing reconstruction accuracy. Event cameras, capturing continuous brightness changes during exposure, can effectively assist in modeling motion blur and improving reconstruction quality. Therefore, we propose Event-driven Bundle Adjusted Deblur Gaussian Splatting (EBAD-Gaussian), which reconstructs sharp 3D Gaussians from event streams and severely blurred images. This method jointly learns the parameters of these Gaussians while recovering camera motion trajectories during exposure time. Specifically, we first construct a blur loss function by synthesizing multiple latent sharp images during the exposure time, minimizing the difference between real and synthesized blurred images. Then we use event stream to supervise the light intensity changes between latent sharp images at any time within the exposure period, supplementing the light intensity dynamic changes lost in RGB images. Furthermore, we optimize the latent sharp images at intermediate exposure times based on the event-based double integral (EDI) prior, applying consistency constraints to enhance the details and texture information of the reconstructed images. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets show that EBAD-Gaussian can achieve high-quality 3D scene reconstruction under the condition of blurred images and event stream inputs.</p></details>|[2504.10012](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10012)|null|

Recent advances have explored two promising directions: multiview generative models that train on 3D consistent datasets but struggle with out-of-distribution generalization, and 3D scene inpainting and completion frameworks that suffer from cross-view inconsistency and suboptimal error handling, as they depend exclusively on depth data or 3D smoothness, which ultimately degrades output quality and computational performance. Building upon these approaches, we present GaussVideoDreamer, which advances generative multimedia approaches by bridging the gap between image, video, and 3D generation, integrating their strengths through two key innovations: (1) A progressive video inpainting strategy that harnesses temporal coherence for improved multiview consistency and faster convergence. (2) A 3D Gaussian Splatting consistency mask to guide the video diffusion with 3D consistent multiview evidence. Our pipeline combines three core components: a geometry-aware initialization protocol, Inconsistency-Aware Gaussian Splatting, and a progressive video inpainting strategy. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves 32% higher LLaVA-IQA scores and at least 2x speedup compared to existing methods while maintaining robust performance across diverse scenes.</p></details>|[2504.10001](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10001)|null|

However, even the state-of-the-art NeRF model, Gaussian Splatting, requires minutes for training, far from the real-time performance required by multimedia scenarios like telemedicine. One of the obstacles is its inefficient sampling, which is only partially addressed by existing works. Existing point-sampling algorithms uniformly sample simple-texture regions (easy to fit) and complex-texture regions (hard to fit), while existing ray-sampling algorithms sample these regions all in the finest granularity (i.e. the pixel level), both wasting GPU training resources. Actually, regions with different texture intensities require different sampling granularities. To this end, we propose a novel dynamic-resolution ray-sampling algorithm, MCBlock, which employs Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to partition each training image into pixel blocks with different sizes for active block-wise training. Specifically, the trees are initialized according to the texture of training images to boost the initialization speed, and an expansion/pruning module dynamically optimizes the block partition. MCBlock is implemented in Nerfstudio, an open-source toolset, and achieves a training acceleration of up to 2.33x, surpassing other ray-sampling algorithms. We believe MCBlock can apply to any cone-tracing NeRF model and contribute to the multimedia community.</p></details>|[2504.09878](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09878)|null|

Conventional optical 3D sensors struggle to capture transparent objects, and machine learning methods are often hindered by their reliance on high-quality datasets. Leveraging NeRF's capability for continuous spatial opacity modeling, our proposed architecture integrates a NeRF-based approach for reconstructing the 3D information of transparent objects. Despite this, certain portions of the reconstructed 3D information may remain incomplete. To address these deficiencies, we introduce a shape-prior-driven completion mechanism, further refined by a geometric pose estimation method we have developed. This allows us to obtain a complete and reliable 3D information of transparent objects. Utilizing this refined data, we perform scene-level grasp prediction and deploy the results in real-world robotic systems. Experimental validation demonstrates the efficacy of our architecture, showcasing its capability to reliably capture 3D information of various transparent objects in cluttered scenes, and correspondingly, achieve high-quality, stables, and executable grasp predictions.</p></details>|[2504.09868](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09868)|null|

However, while many methods focus on geometric consistency, they often neglect the potential of text-driven guidance to enhance semantic understanding, which is crucial for accurately reconstructing fine-grained details in complex scenes. To address this limitation, we propose TextSplat--the first text-driven Generalizable Gaussian Splatting framework. By employing a text-guided fusion of diverse semantic cues, our framework learns robust cross-modal feature representations that improve the alignment of geometric and semantic information, producing high-fidelity 3D reconstructions. Specifically, our framework employs three parallel modules to obtain complementary representations: the Diffusion Prior Depth Estimator for accurate depth information, the Semantic Aware Segmentation Network for detailed semantic information, and the Multi-View Interaction Network for refined cross-view features. Then, in the Text-Guided Semantic Fusion Module, these representations are integrated via the text-guided and attention-based feature aggregation mechanism, resulting in enhanced 3D Gaussian parameters enriched with detailed semantic cues. Experimental results on various benchmark datasets demonstrate improved performance compared to existing methods across multiple evaluation metrics, validating the effectiveness of our framework. The code will be publicly available.</p></details>|[2504.09588](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09588)|null|

While state-of-the-art methods rely on tailored and/or high-end equipment for data acquisition, which can be cumbersome and time-consuming, this work introduces a scalable polarization-aided approach that employs cost-effective acquisition tools. By attaching a linear polarizer to readily available RGB cameras, multi-view polarization images can be captured without the need for advance calibration or precise measurements of the polarizer angle, substantially reducing system construction costs. The proposed approach represents polarimetric BRDF, Stokes vectors, and polarization states of object surfaces as neural implicit fields. These fields, combined with the polarizer angle, are retrieved by optimizing the rendering loss of input polarized images. By leveraging fundamental physical principles for the implicit representation of polarization rendering, our method demonstrates superiority over existing techniques through experiments in public datasets and real captured images on both reconstruction and novel view synthesis.</p></details>|[2504.07025](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07025)|null|

Solutions based on multi-view RGB images are attractive due to their scalability and affordability, enabling volumetric measurements that 2D approaches cannot directly capture. While advanced methods like Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) have shown promise, their application has been limited to counting or extracting traits from only a few plants or organs. Furthermore, accurately measuring complex structures like individual wheat heads-essential for studying crop yields-remains particularly challenging due to occlusions and the dense arrangement of crop canopies in field conditions. The recent development of 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) offers a promising alternative for HTFP due to its high-quality reconstructions and explicit point-based representation. In this paper, we present Wheat3DGS, a novel approach that leverages 3DGS and the Segment Anything Model (SAM) for precise 3D instance segmentation and morphological measurement of hundreds of wheat heads automatically, representing the first application of 3DGS to HTFP. We validate the accuracy of wheat head extraction against high-resolution laser scan data, obtaining per-instance mean absolute percentage errors of 15.1%, 18.3%, and 40.2% for length, width, and volume. We provide additional comparisons to NeRF-based approaches and traditional Muti-View Stereo (MVS), demonstrating superior results.

Methods apply it to relighting by separating radiance into BRDF parameters and lighting, yet produce inferior relighting quality with artifacts and unnatural indirect illumination due to the limited capability of each Gaussian, which has constant material parameters and normal, alongside the absence of physical constraints for indirect lighting. In this paper, we present a novel framework called Spatially-vayring Gaussian Inverse Rendering (SVG-IR), aimed at enhancing both NVS and relighting quality. To this end, we propose a new representation-Spatially-varying Gaussian (SVG)-that allows per-Gaussian spatially varying parameters. This enhanced representation is complemented by a SVG splatting scheme akin to vertex/fragment shading in traditional graphics pipelines. Furthermore, we integrate a physically-based indirect lighting model, enabling more realistic relighting. The proposed SVG-IR framework significantly improves rendering quality, outperforming state-of-the-art NeRF-based methods by 2.5 dB in peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) and surpassing existing Gaussian-based techniques by 3.5 dB in relighting tasks, all while maintaining a real-time rendering speed.</p></details>|[2504.06815](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06815)|null|

Our simulations reproduce observed $M_{\rm star}$-SFR relations and $\delta$ at these redshifts. We find: (1) protocluster (PC) and mean-density field (MF) galaxies show similar $M_{\rm star}$-SFR relations, with PC galaxies extending to higher $M_{\rm star}$ and SFR. (2) UV-bright PC galaxies ($M_{\rm UV}\lesssim -20$~mag) have $>2$ mag higher UV attenuation and shallower UV slopes than MF galaxies. (3) $\delta$ increases with redshift, depending on observational parameters (e.g., $\delta\sim50$ at $z=14$ to $\delta\sim3$ at $z=6$ for a search volume of $\sim3000$~cMpc$^3$ and a limiting magnitude of $M_{\rm UV}=-17$~mag). These results indicate that enhanced star formation in PCs is driven by massive galaxy overdensity, not anomalously high specific SFR. While simulated $\delta$ agrees with observed PC candidates (potential Coma progenitors), some MF galaxies show comparable $\delta$. We propose a robust PC identification method using both $\delta$ and $M_{\rm star}$ of the most massive member. Critical $M_{\rm star}$ thresholds for Coma progenitors are estimated ($10^{7.1}$ to $10^{10.2}$ M$_\odot$ from $z=14$ to 6).

|**2025-04-09**|**GSta: Efficient Training Scheme with Siestaed Gaussians for Monocular 3D Scene Reconstruction**|<details><summary>Show Abstract</summary><p>Gaussian Splatting (GS) is a popular approach for 3D reconstruction, mostly due to its ability to converge reasonably fast, faithfully represent the scene and render (novel) views in a fast fashion. However, it suffers from large storage and memory requirements, and its training speed still lags behind the hash-grid based radiance field approaches (e.g. Instant-NGP), which makes it especially difficult to deploy them in robotics scenarios, where 3D reconstruction is crucial for accurate operation. In this paper, we propose GSta that dynamically identifies Gaussians that have converged well during training, based on their positional and color gradient norms. By forcing such Gaussians into a siesta and stopping their updates (freezing) during training, we improve training speed with competitive accuracy compared to state of the art. We also propose an early stopping mechanism based on the PSNR values computed on a subset of training images. Combined with other improvements, such as integrating a learning rate scheduler, GSta achieves an improved Pareto front in convergence speed, memory and storage requirements, while preserving quality. We also show that GSta can improve other methods and complement orthogonal approaches in efficiency improvement; once combined with Trick-GS, GSta achieves up to 5x faster training, 16x smaller disk size compared to vanilla GS, while having comparable accuracy and consuming only half the peak memory.

|**2025-04-09**|**Stochastic Ray Tracing of 3D Transparent Gaussians**|<details><summary>Show Abstract</summary><p>3D Gaussian splatting has recently been widely adopted as a 3D representation for novel-view synthesis, relighting, and text-to-3D generation tasks, offering realistic and detailed results through a collection of explicit 3D Gaussians carrying opacities and view-dependent colors. However, efficient rendering of many transparent primitives remains a significant challenge. Existing approaches either rasterize the 3D Gaussians with approximate sorting per view or rely on high-end RTX GPUs to exhaustively process all ray-Gaussian intersections (bounding Gaussians by meshes). This paper proposes a stochastic ray tracing method to render 3D clouds of transparent primitives. Instead of processing all ray-Gaussian intersections in sequential order, each ray traverses the acceleration structure only once, randomly accepting and shading a single intersection (or N intersections, using a simple extension). This approach minimizes shading time and avoids sorting the Gaussians along the ray while minimizing the register usage and maximizing parallelism even on low-end GPUs. The cost of rays through the Gaussian asset is comparable to that of standard mesh-intersection rays. While our method introduces noise, the shading is unbiased, and the variance is slight, as stochastic acceptance is importance-sampled based on accumulated opacity. The alignment with the Monte Carlo philosophy simplifies implementation and easily integrates our method into a conventional path-tracing framework.</p></details>|[2504.06598](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06598)|null|

|**2025-04-03**|**Adaptive Frequency Enhancement Network for Remote Sensing Image Semantic Segmentation**|<details><summary>Show Abstract</summary><p>Semantic segmentation of high-resolution remote sensing images plays a crucial role in land-use monitoring and urban planning. Recent remarkable progress in deep learning-based methods makes it possible to generate satisfactory segmentation results. However, existing methods still face challenges in adapting network parameters to various land cover distributions and enhancing the interaction between spatial and frequency domain features. To address these challenges, we propose the Adaptive Frequency Enhancement Network (AFENet), which integrates two key components: the Adaptive Frequency and Spatial feature Interaction Module (AFSIM) and the Selective feature Fusion Module (SFM). AFSIM dynamically separates and modulates high- and low-frequency features according to the content of the input image. It adaptively generates two masks to separate high- and low-frequency components, therefore providing optimal details and contextual supplementary information for ground object feature representation. SFM selectively fuses global context and local detailed features to enhance the network's representation capability. Hence, the interactions between frequency and spatial features are further enhanced. Extensive experiments on three publicly available datasets demonstrate that the proposed AFENet outperforms state-of-the-art methods. In addition, we also validate the effectiveness of AFSIM and SFM in managing diverse land cover types and complex scenarios. Our codes are available at https://github.com/oucailab/AFENet.</p></details>|[2504.02647](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02647)|**[link](https://github.com/oucailab/AFENet.)**|

Our approach extends the TensoRF NeRF model by incorporating a dedicated watermark grid alongside the existing geometry and appearance grids. This extension ensures higher watermark capacity without entangling watermark signals with scene content. We propose a FiLM-based conditional modulation mechanism that dynamically activates watermarks based on input identifiers, allowing multiple independent watermarks to be embedded and extracted without requiring model retraining. MultiNeRF is validated on the NeRF-Synthetic and LLFF datasets, with statistically significant improvements in robust capacity without compromising rendering quality. By generalizing single-watermark NeRF methods into a flexible multi-watermarking framework, MultiNeRF provides a scalable solution for 3D content. attribution.</p></details>|[2504.02517](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02517)|null|

While previous 3D Gaussian Splatting (GS)-based methods largely depended on depth sensors, our approach reduces the hardware dependency and only requires RGB input, leveraging online visual odometry (VO) to generate sparse point clouds in real-time. To reduce redundancy and enhance the quality of 3D scene reconstruction, we implemented a series of methodological enhancements in 3D Gaussian mapping. Firstly, we introduced dynamic 3D Gaussian insertion to avoid adding redundant Gaussians in previously well-reconstructed areas. Secondly, we introduced clarity-enhancing Gaussian densification module and planar regularization to handle texture-less areas and flat surfaces better. We achieved precise camera tracking results both on the synthetic Replica and real-world TUM-RGBD datasets, comparable to those of the state-of-the-art.

The success of NeRF-based generative methods indicates a promising direction to address this challenge. However, unlike their success at the object level, existing scene-level generative methods require additional information, such as multiple views, depth images, or semantic guidance, rather than relying solely on RGB images. This is because NeRF-based methods necessitate prior knowledge of camera poses, which is challenging to approximate for indoor scenes due to the complexity of defining alignment and the difficulty of globally estimating poses from a single image, given the unseen parts behind the camera. To address this challenge, we redefine global poses within the framework of Local-Pose-Alignment (LPA) -- an anchor-based multi-local-coordinate system that uses a selected number of anchors as the roots of these coordinates. Building on this foundation, we introduce LPA-GAN, a novel NeRF-based generative approach that incorporates specific modifications to estimate the priors of camera poses under LPA. It also co-optimizes the pose predictor and scene generation processes. Our ablation study and comparisons with straightforward extensions of NeRF-based object generative methods demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. Furthermore, visual comparisons with other techniques reveal that our method achieves superior view-to-view consistency and semantic normality.</p></details>|[2504.02337](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02337)|null|

While state-of-the-art methods leverage 3D Gaussian Splatting with score distillation to enhance multi-view rendering through pre-trained text-to-image (T2I) models, they suffer from inherent view biases in T2I priors. These biases lead to inconsistent 3D generation, particularly manifesting as the multi-face Janus problem, where objects exhibit conflicting features across views. To address this fundamental challenge, we propose ConsDreamer, a novel framework that mitigates view bias by refining both the conditional and unconditional terms in the score distillation process: (1) a View Disentanglement Module (VDM) that eliminates viewpoint biases in conditional prompts by decoupling irrelevant view components and injecting precise camera parameters; and (2) a similarity-based partial order loss that enforces geometric consistency in the unconditional term by aligning cosine similarities with azimuth relationships. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ConsDreamer effectively mitigates the multi-face Janus problem in text-to-3D generation, outperforming existing methods in both visual quality and consistency.</p></details>|[2504.02316](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02316)|null|

We propose a digital-twin imaging method based on Gaussian splatting to observe an object behind a scattering medium. A digital twin model built through data assimilation, emulates the behavior of objects and environmental changes in a virtual space. By constructing a digital twin using point clouds composed of Gaussians and simulating the scattering process through the convolution of a point spread function, three-dimensional objects behind a scattering medium can be reproduced as a digital twin. In this study, a high-contrast digital twin reproducing a three-dimensional object was successfully constructed from degraded images, assuming that data were acquired from wavefronts disturbed by a scattering medium. This technique reproduces objects by integrating data processing with image measurements.</p></details>|[2504.02278](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02278)|null|

Specifically, our approach focuses on synthesizing foreground components, such as various human instances in motion within complex scene backgrounds, from UAV perspectives. This is achieved by integrating 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) for reconstructing backgrounds along with controllable synthetic human models that display diverse appearances and actions in multiple poses. To the best of our knowledge, UAVTwin is the first approach for UAV-based perception that is capable of generating high-fidelity digital twins based on 3DGS. The proposed work significantly enhances downstream models through data augmentation for real-world environments with multiple dynamic objects and significant appearance variations-both of which typically introduce artifacts in 3DGS-based modeling. To tackle these challenges, we propose a novel appearance modeling strategy and a mask refinement module to enhance the training of 3D Gaussian Splatting. We demonstrate the high quality of neural rendering by achieving a 1.23 dB improvement in PSNR compared to recent methods. Furthermore, we validate the effectiveness of data augmentation by showing a 2.5% to 13.7% improvement in mAP for the human detection task.</p></details>|[2504.02158](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02158)|null|
|**2025-04-02**|**A Chefs KISS -- Utilizing semantic information in both ICP and SLAM framework**|<details><summary>Show Abstract</summary><p>For utilizing autonomous vehicle in urban areas a reliable localization is needed. Especially when HD maps are used, a precise and repeatable method has to be chosen. Therefore accurate map generation but also re-localization against these maps is necessary. Due to best 3D reconstruction of the surrounding, LiDAR has become a reliable modality for localization. The latest LiDAR odometry estimation are based on iterative closest point (ICP) approaches, namely KISS-ICP and SAGE-ICP. We extend the capabilities of KISS-ICP by incorporating semantic information into the point alignment process using a generalizable approach with minimal parameter tuning. This enhancement allows us to surpass KISS-ICP in terms of absolute trajectory error (ATE), the primary metric for map accuracy. Additionally, we improve the Cartographer mapping framework to handle semantic information. Cartographer facilitates loop closure detection over larger areas, mitigating odometry drift and further enhancing ATE accuracy. By integrating semantic information into the mapping process, we enable the filtering of specific classes, such as parked vehicles, from the resulting map. This filtering improves relocalization quality by addressing temporal changes, such as vehicles being moved.</p></details>|[2504.02086](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02086)|null|

This study systematically evaluates key flight parameters-ground sampling distance (GSD) and image overlap-to optimize the 3D reconstruction of complex rooftop infrastructure. Controlled UAV flights were conducted over a multi-segment rooftop at Queen's University using a DJI Phantom 4 Pro V2, with varied GSD and overlap settings. The collected data were processed using Reality Capture software and evaluated against ground truth models generated from UAV-based LiDAR and terrestrial laser scanning (TLS). Experimental results indicate that a GSD range of 0.75-1.26 cm combined with 85% image overlap achieves a high degree of model accuracy, while minimizing images collected and flight time. These findings provide guidance for planning autonomous UAV flight paths for efficient rooftop assessments.</p></details>|[2504.02084](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02084)|null|

We introduce WorldPrompter, a novel generative pipeline for synthesizing traversable 3D scenes from text prompts. We leverage panoramic videos as an intermediate representation to model the 360{\deg} details of a scene. WorldPrompter incorporates a conditional 360{\deg} panoramic video generator, capable of producing a 128-frame video that simulates a person walking through and capturing a virtual environment. The resulting video is then reconstructed as Gaussian splats by a fast feedforward 3D reconstructor, enabling a true walkable experience within the 3D scene. Experiments demonstrate that our panoramic video generation model achieves convincing view consistency across frames, enabling high-quality panoramic Gaussian splat reconstruction and facilitating traversal over an area of the scene. Qualitative and quantitative results also show it outperforms the state-of-the-art 360{\deg} video generators and 3D scene generation models.</p></details>|[2504.02045](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02045)|null|

Our approach addresses two critical challenges: (1) precise 3D object extraction from the source scene, and (2) faithful relighting of the transferred object in the target scene without explicit material property estimation. TranSplat fits a splatting model to the source scene, using 2D object masks to drive fine-grained 3D segmentation. Following user-guided insertion of the object into the target scene, along with automatic refinement of position and orientation, TranSplat derives per-Gaussian radiance transfer functions via spherical harmonic analysis to adapt the object's appearance to match the target scene's lighting environment. This relighting strategy does not require explicitly estimating physical scene properties such as BRDFs. Evaluated on several synthetic and real-world scenes and objects, TranSplat yields excellent 3D object extractions and relighting performance compared to recent baseline methods and visually convincing cross-scene object transfers. We conclude by discussing the limitations of the approach.</p></details>|[2503.22676](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22676)|null|

In this paper, we present a novel approach that leverages an Audio Factorization Plane (Audio-Plane) based Gaussian Splatting for high-quality and real-time talking head generation. For modeling a dynamic talking head, 4D volume representation is needed. However, directly storing a dense 4D grid is impractical due to the high cost and lack of scalability for longer durations. We overcome this challenge with the proposed Audio-Plane, where the 4D volume representation is decomposed into audio-independent space planes and audio-dependent planes. This provides a compact and interpretable feature representation for talking head, facilitating more precise audio-aware spatial encoding and enhanced audio-driven lip dynamic modeling. To further improve speech dynamics, we develop a dynamic splatting method that helps the network more effectively focus on modeling the dynamics of the mouth region. Extensive experiments demonstrate that by integrating these innovations with the powerful Gaussian Splatting, our method is capable of synthesizing highly realistic talking videos in real time while ensuring precise audio-lip synchronization.

Deep depth estimation is promising but existing works struggle with depth discontinuities, resulting in noisy predictions at object boundaries and do not achieve complete reconstruction omitting occluded surfaces.

Although Scaffold-GS achieves higher quality real-time rendering compared to the original 3D-GS, its fine-grained rendering of the scene is extremely dependent on adequate viewing angles. The spectral bias of neural network learning results in Scaffold-GS's poor ability to perceive and learn high-frequency information in the scene. In this work, we propose enhancing the manifold complexity of input features and using network-based feature map loss to improve the image reconstruction quality of 3D-GS models. We introduce AH-GS, which enables 3D Gaussians in structurally complex regions to obtain higher-frequency encodings, allowing the model to more effectively learn the high-frequency information of the scene. Additionally, we incorporate high-frequency reinforce loss to further enhance the model's ability to capture detailed frequency information. Our result demonstrates that our model significantly improves rendering fidelity, and in specific scenarios (e.g., MipNeRf360-garden), our method exceeds the rendering quality of Scaffold-GS in just 15K iterations.</p></details>|[2503.22324](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22324)|null|
|**2025-03-28**|**Follow Your Motion: A Generic Temporal Consistency Portrait Editing Framework with Trajectory Guidance**|<details><summary>Show Abstract</summary><p>Pre-trained conditional diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable potential in image editing. However, they often face challenges with temporal consistency, particularly in the talking head domain, where continuous changes in facial expressions intensify the level of difficulty. These issues stem from the independent editing of individual images and the inherent loss of temporal continuity during the editing process. In this paper, we introduce Follow Your Motion (FYM), a generic framework for maintaining temporal consistency in portrait editing. Specifically, given portrait images rendered by a pre-trained 3D Gaussian Splatting model, we first develop a diffusion model that intuitively and inherently learns motion trajectory changes at different scales and pixel coordinates, from the first frame to each subsequent frame. This approach ensures that temporally inconsistent edited avatars inherit the motion information from the rendered avatars. Secondly, to maintain fine-grained expression temporal consistency in talking head editing, we propose a dynamic re-weighted attention mechanism. This mechanism assigns higher weight coefficients to landmark points in space and dynamically updates these weights based on landmark loss, achieving more consistent and refined facial expressions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms existing approaches in terms of temporal consistency and can be used to optimize and compensate for temporally inconsistent outputs in a range of applications, such as text-driven editing, relighting, and various other applications.</p></details>|[2503.22225](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22225)|null|

However, NNFM loss does not consider global style information. In addition, the implicit representation of NeRF limits their fine-grained control over the resulting scenes. In this paper, we introduce ABC-GS, a novel framework based on 3D Gaussian Splatting to achieve high-quality 3D style transfer. To this end, a controllable matching stage is designed to achieve precise alignment between scene content and style features through segmentation masks. Moreover, a style transfer loss function based on feature alignment is proposed to ensure that the outcomes of style transfer accurately reflect the global style of the reference image. Furthermore, the original geometric information of the scene is preserved with the depth loss and Gaussian regularization terms. Extensive experiments show that our ABC-GS provides controllability of style transfer and achieves stylization results that are more faithfully aligned with the global style of the chosen artistic reference.

However, most existing methods rely on 2D pixel-level parsing, leading to multi-view inconsistencies and poor 3D object retrieval. Moreover, they are limited to static scenes and struggle with dynamic scenes due to the complexities of motion modeling. In this paper, we propose Segment then Splat, a 3D-aware open vocabulary segmentation approach for both static and dynamic scenes based on Gaussian Splatting. Segment then Splat reverses the long established approach of "segmentation after reconstruction" by dividing Gaussians into distinct object sets before reconstruction. Once the reconstruction is complete, the scene is naturally segmented into individual objects, achieving true 3D segmentation. This approach not only eliminates Gaussian-object misalignment issues in dynamic scenes but also accelerates the optimization process, as it eliminates the need for learning a separate language field. After optimization, a CLIP embedding is assigned to each object to enable open-vocabulary querying. Extensive experiments on various datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method in both static and dynamic scenarios.</p></details>|[2503.22204](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22204)|null|

Recently, inspired by the remarkable success of NVS using 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), researchers have sought to extend 3D Gaussian models to four dimensions (4D) for dynamic novel-view synthesis. However, methods based on 4D rotation and scaling introduce spatiotemporal deformation into the 4D covariance matrix, necessitating the slicing of 4D Gaussians into 3D Gaussians. This process increases redundant computations as timestamps change-an inherent characteristic of dynamic scene rendering. Additionally, performing calculations on a four-dimensional matrix is computationally intensive. In this paper, we introduce Disentangled 4D Gaussian Splatting (Disentangled4DGS), a novel representation and rendering approach that disentangles temporal and spatial deformations, thereby eliminating the reliance on 4D matrix computations. We extend the 3DGS rendering process to 4D, enabling the projection of temporal and spatial deformations into dynamic 2D Gaussians in ray space. Consequently, our method facilitates faster dynamic scene synthesis. Moreover, it reduces storage requirements by at least 4.5\% due to our efficient presentation method. Our approach achieves an unprecedented average rendering speed of 343 FPS at a resolution of $1352\times1014$ on an RTX 3090 GPU, with experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrating its competitive performance in both monocular and multi-view scenarios.</p></details>|[2503.22159](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22159)|null|

Traditional NeRF-based reconstruction methods require cameras to move around stationary objects, but this approach is impractical for high-throughput environments where objects are rapidly imaged while moving on conveyors or rotating pedestals. To address this limitation, we develop a variant of NeRF-based PCD reconstruction that uses a single stationary camera to capture images as the object rotates on a pedestal. Our workflow comprises COLMAP-based pose estimation, a straightforward pose transformation to simulate camera movement, and subsequent standard NeRF training. A defined Region of Interest (ROI) excludes irrelevant scene data, enabling the generation of high-resolution point clouds (10M points). Experimental results demonstrate excellent reconstruction fidelity, with precision-recall analyses yielding an F-score close to 100.00 across all evaluated plant objects. Although pose estimation remains computationally intensive with a stationary camera setup, overall training and reconstruction times are competitive, validating the method's feasibility for practical high-throughput indoor phenotyping applications. Our findings indicate that high-quality NeRF-based 3D reconstructions are achievable using a stationary camera, eliminating the need for complex camera motion or costly imaging equipment. This approach is especially beneficial when employing expensive and delicate instruments, such as hyperspectral cameras, for 3D plant phenotyping. Future work will focus on optimizing pose estimation techniques and further streamlining the methodology to facilitate seamless integration into automated, high-throughput 3D phenotyping pipelines.</p></details>|[2503.21958](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21958)|null|

In this paper, we propose a two-phase head avatar reconstruction network that incorporates a refined 3D mesh representation. Our approach, in contrast to existing methods that rely on coarse template-based 3D representations derived from 3DMM, aims to learn a refined mesh representation suitable for a NeRF that captures complex facial nuances. In the first phase, we train 3DMM-stored NeRF with an initial mesh to utilize geometric priors and integrate observations across frames using a consistent set of latent codes. In the second phase, we leverage a novel mesh refinement procedure based on an SDF constructed from the density field of the initial NeRF. To mitigate the typical noise in the NeRF density field without compromising the features of the 3DMM, we employ Laplace smoothing on the displacement field. Subsequently, we apply a second-phase training with these refined meshes, directing the learning process of the network towards capturing intricate facial details. Our experiments demonstrate that our method further enhances the NeRF rendering based on the initial mesh and achieves performance superior to state-of-the-art methods in reconstructing high-fidelity head avatars with such input.</p></details>|[2503.21886](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21886)|null|

Prior work, such as LangSplat, addressed this task by retrieving these regions in the form of segmentation masks on 2D renderings. More recently, OpenGaussian introduced point-level querying, which directly selects a subset of 3D Gaussians. In this work, we propose a point-level querying method that builds upon LangSplat's framework. Our approach improves the framework in two key ways: (a) we leverage masklets from the Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2) to establish semantic consistent ground-truth for distilling the language Gaussians; (b) we introduces a novel two-step querying approach that first retrieves the distilled ground-truth and subsequently uses the ground-truth to query the individual Gaussians.

In contrast, traditional physics-based simulations can generate realistic rain effects, such as raindrops and splashes, but they often rely on skilled artists to carefully set up high-fidelity scenes. This process lacks flexibility and scalability, limiting its applicability to broader, open-world environments. In this work, we introduce RainyGS, a novel approach that leverages the strengths of both physics-based modeling and 3DGS to generate photorealistic, dynamic rain effects in open-world scenes with physical accuracy. At the core of our method is the integration of physically-based raindrop and shallow water simulation techniques within the fast 3DGS rendering framework, enabling realistic and efficient simulations of raindrop behavior, splashes, and reflections. Our method supports synthesizing rain effects at over 30 fps, offering users flexible control over rain intensity -- from light drizzles to heavy downpours. We demonstrate that RainyGS performs effectively for both real-world outdoor scenes and large-scale driving scenarios, delivering more photorealistic and physically-accurate rain effects compared to state-of-the-art methods.

However, most existing VPR datasets are limited to single-viewpoint scenarios, leading to reduced recognition accuracy, particularly in multi-directional driving or feature-sparse scenes. Moreover, obtaining additional data to mitigate these limitations is often expensive. This paper introduces a novel training paradigm to improve the performance of existing VPR networks by enhancing multi-view diversity within current datasets through uncertainty estimation and NeRF-based data augmentation. Specifically, we initially train NeRF using the existing VPR dataset. Then, our devised self-supervised uncertainty estimation network identifies places with high uncertainty. The poses of these uncertain places are input into NeRF to generate new synthetic observations for further training of VPR networks. Additionally, we propose an improved storage method for efficient organization of augmented and original training data. We conducted extensive experiments on three datasets and tested three different VPR backbone networks. The results demonstrate that our proposed training paradigm significantly improves VPR performance by fully utilizing existing data, outperforming other training approaches. We further validated the effectiveness of our approach on self-recorded indoor and outdoor datasets, consistently demonstrating superior results.

|**2025-03-27**|**Frequency-Aware Gaussian Splatting Decomposition**|<details><summary>Show Abstract</summary><p>3D Gaussian Splatting (3D-GS) has revolutionized novel view synthesis with its efficient, explicit representation. However, it lacks frequency interpretability, making it difficult to separate low-frequency structures from fine details. We introduce a frequency-decomposed 3D-GS framework that groups 3D Gaussians that correspond to subbands in the Laplacian Pyrmaids of the input images. Our approach enforces coherence within each subband (i.e., group of 3D Gaussians) through dedicated regularization, ensuring well-separated frequency components. We extend color values to both positive and negative ranges, allowing higher-frequency layers to add or subtract residual details. To stabilize optimization, we employ a progressive training scheme that refines details in a coarse-to-fine manner. Beyond interpretability, this frequency-aware design unlocks a range of practical benefits. Explicit frequency separation enables advanced 3D editing and stylization, allowing precise manipulation of specific frequency bands. It also supports dynamic level-of-detail control for progressive rendering, streaming, foveated rendering and fast geometry interaction. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our method provides improved control and flexibility for emerging applications in scene editing and interactive rendering. Our code will be made publicly available.</p></details>|[2503.21226](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21226)|null|
|**2025-03-27**|**GenFusion: Closing the Loop between Reconstruction and Generation via Videos**|<details><summary>Show Abstract</summary><p>Recently, 3D reconstruction and generation have demonstrated impressive novel view synthesis results, achieving high fidelity and efficiency. However, a notable conditioning gap can be observed between these two fields, e.g., scalable 3D scene reconstruction often requires densely captured views, whereas 3D generation typically relies on a single or no input view, which significantly limits their applications. We found that the source of this phenomenon lies in the misalignment between 3D constraints and generative priors. To address this problem, we propose a reconstruction-driven video diffusion model that learns to condition video frames on artifact-prone RGB-D renderings. Moreover, we propose a cyclical fusion pipeline that iteratively adds restoration frames from the generative model to the training set, enabling progressive expansion and addressing the viewpoint saturation limitations seen in previous reconstruction and generation pipelines. Our evaluation, including view synthesis from sparse view and masked input, validates the effectiveness of our approach.</p></details>|[2503.21219](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21219)|null|
|**2025-03-27**|**StyledStreets: Multi-style Street Simulator with Spatial and Temporal Consistency**|<details><summary>Show Abstract</summary><p>Urban scene reconstruction requires modeling both static infrastructure and dynamic elements while supporting diverse environmental conditions. We present \textbf{StyledStreets}, a multi-style street simulator that achieves instruction-driven scene editing with guaranteed spatial and temporal consistency. Building on a state-of-the-art Gaussian Splatting framework for street scenarios enhanced by our proposed pose optimization and multi-view training, our method enables photorealistic style transfers across seasons, weather conditions, and camera setups through three key innovations: First, a hybrid embedding scheme disentangles persistent scene geometry from transient style attributes, allowing realistic environmental edits while preserving structural integrity. Second, uncertainty-aware rendering mitigates supervision noise from diffusion priors, enabling robust training across extreme style variations. Third, a unified parametric model prevents geometric drift through regularized updates, maintaining multi-view consistency across seven vehicle-mounted cameras.   Our framework preserves the original scene's motion patterns and geometric relationships. Qualitative results demonstrate plausible transitions between diverse conditions (snow, sandstorm, night), while quantitative evaluations show state-of-the-art geometric accuracy under style transfers. The approach establishes new capabilities for urban simulation, with applications in autonomous vehicle testing and augmented reality systems requiring reliable environmental consistency. Codes will be publicly available upon publication.</p></details>|[2503.21104](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21104)|null|
|**2025-03-26**|**PGC: Physics-Based Gaussian Cloth from a Single Pose**|<details><summary>Show Abstract</summary><p>We introduce a novel approach to reconstruct simulation-ready garments with intricate appearance. Despite recent advancements, existing methods often struggle to balance the need for accurate garment reconstruction with the ability to generalize to new poses and body shapes or require large amounts of data to achieve this. In contrast, our method only requires a multi-view capture of a single static frame. We represent garments as hybrid mesh-embedded 3D Gaussian splats, where the Gaussians capture near-field shading and high-frequency details, while the mesh encodes far-field albedo and optimized reflectance parameters. We achieve novel pose generalization by exploiting the mesh from our hybrid approach, enabling physics-based simulation and surface rendering techniques, while also capturing fine details with Gaussians that accurately reconstruct garment details. Our optimized garments can be used for simulating garments on novel poses, and garment relighting.

However, these methods struggle in few-shot scenarios due to limited supervision. In this paper, we present NexusGS, a 3DGS-based approach that enhances novel view synthesis from sparse-view images by directly embedding depth information into point clouds, without relying on complex manual regularizations. Exploiting the inherent epipolar geometry of 3DGS, our method introduces a novel point cloud densification strategy that initializes 3DGS with a dense point cloud, reducing randomness in point placement while preventing over-smoothing and overfitting. Specifically, NexusGS comprises three key steps: Epipolar Depth Nexus, Flow-Resilient Depth Blending, and Flow-Filtered Depth Pruning. These steps leverage optical flow and camera poses to compute accurate depth maps, while mitigating the inaccuracies often associated with optical flow. By incorporating epipolar depth priors, NexusGS ensures reliable dense point cloud coverage and supports stable 3DGS training under sparse-view conditions. Experiments demonstrate that NexusGS significantly enhances depth accuracy and rendering quality, surpassing state-of-the-art methods by a considerable margin. Furthermore, we validate the superiority of our generated point clouds by substantially boosting the performance of competing methods.

|**2025-03-24**|**GS-Marker: Generalizable and Robust Watermarking for 3D Gaussian Splatting**|<details><summary>Show Abstract</summary><p>In the Generative AI era, safeguarding 3D models has become increasingly urgent. While invisible watermarking is well-established for 2D images with encoder-decoder frameworks, generalizable and robust solutions for 3D remain elusive. The main difficulty arises from the renderer between the 3D encoder and 2D decoder, which disrupts direct gradient flow and complicates training. Existing 3D methods typically rely on per-scene iterative optimization, resulting in time inefficiency and limited generalization. In this work, we propose a single-pass watermarking approach for 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), a well-known yet underexplored representation for watermarking. We identify two major challenges: (1) ensuring effective training generalized across diverse 3D models, and (2) reliably extracting watermarks from free-view renderings, even under distortions. Our framework, named GS-Marker, incorporates a 3D encoder to embed messages, distortion layers to enhance resilience against various distortions, and a 2D decoder to extract watermarks from renderings. A key innovation is the Adaptive Marker Control mechanism that adaptively perturbs the initially optimized 3DGS, escaping local minima and improving both training stability and convergence. Extensive experiments show that GS-Marker outperforms per-scene training approaches in terms of decoding accuracy and model fidelity, while also significantly reducing computation time.</p></details>|[2503.18718](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18718)|null|

Our work contains a mathematically rigorous and geometrically intuitive derivation about how to efficiently estimate all relevant quantities for rendering RayGS models, structured with respect to standard hardware rasterization shaders. Our solution is the first enabling rendering RayGS models at sufficiently high frame rates to support quality-sensitive applications like Virtual and Mixed Reality. Our second contribution enables alias-free rendering for RayGS, by addressing MIP-related issues arising when rendering diverging scales during training and testing. We demonstrate significant performance gains, across different benchmark scenes, while retaining state-of-the-art appearance quality of RayGS.</p></details>|[2503.18682](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18682)|null|
|**2025-03-24**|**LLGS: Unsupervised Gaussian Splatting for Image Enhancement and Reconstruction in Pure Dark Environment**|<details><summary>Show Abstract</summary><p>3D Gaussian Splatting has shown remarkable capabilities in novel view rendering tasks and exhibits significant potential for multi-view optimization.However, the original 3D Gaussian Splatting lacks color representation for inputs in low-light environments. Simply using enhanced images as inputs would lead to issues with multi-view consistency, and current single-view enhancement systems rely on pre-trained data, lacking scene generalization. These problems limit the application of 3D Gaussian Splatting in low-light conditions in the field of robotics, including high-fidelity modeling and feature matching. To address these challenges, we propose an unsupervised multi-view stereoscopic system based on Gaussian Splatting, called Low-Light Gaussian Splatting (LLGS). This system aims to enhance images in low-light environments while reconstructing the scene. Our method introduces a decomposable Gaussian representation called M-Color, which separately characterizes color information for targeted enhancement. Furthermore, we propose an unsupervised optimization method with zero-knowledge priors, using direction-based enhancement to ensure multi-view consistency. Experiments conducted on real-world datasets demonstrate that our system outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both low-light enhancement and 3D Gaussian Splatting.</p></details>|[2503.18640](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18640)|null|
|**2025-03-25**|**LookCloser: Frequency-aware Radiance Field for Tiny-Detail Scene**|<details><summary>Show Abstract</summary><p>Humans perceive and comprehend their surroundings through information spanning multiple frequencies. In immersive scenes, people naturally scan their environment to grasp its overall structure while examining fine details of objects that capture their attention. However, current NeRF frameworks primarily focus on modeling either high-frequency local views or the broad structure of scenes with low-frequency information, which is limited to balancing both. We introduce FA-NeRF, a novel frequency-aware framework for view synthesis that simultaneously captures the overall scene structure and high-definition details within a single NeRF model. To achieve this, we propose a 3D frequency quantification method that analyzes the scene's frequency distribution, enabling frequency-aware rendering. Our framework incorporates a frequency grid for fast convergence and querying, a frequency-aware feature re-weighting strategy to balance features across different frequency contents. Extensive experiments show that our method significantly outperforms existing approaches in modeling entire scenes while preserving fine details.

However, its training process suffers from coupled opacity-color optimization that frequently converges to local minima, producing floater artifacts that degrade visual fidelity. We present StableGS, a framework that eliminates floaters through cross-view depth consistency constraints while introducing a dual-opacity GS model to decouple geometry and material properties of translucent objects. To further enhance reconstruction quality in weakly-textured regions, we integrate DUSt3R depth estimation, significantly improving geometric stability. Our method fundamentally addresses 3DGS training instabilities, outperforming existing state-of-the-art methods across open-source datasets.</p></details>|[2503.18458](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18458)|null|
|**2025-03-24**|**4DGC: Rate-Aware 4D Gaussian Compression for Efficient Streamable Free-Viewpoint Video**|<details><summary>Show Abstract</summary><p>3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has substantial potential for enabling photorealistic Free-Viewpoint Video (FVV) experiences. However, the vast number of Gaussians and their associated attributes poses significant challenges for storage and transmission. Existing methods typically handle dynamic 3DGS representation and compression separately, neglecting motion information and the rate-distortion (RD) trade-off during training, leading to performance degradation and increased model redundancy. To address this gap, we propose 4DGC, a novel rate-aware 4D Gaussian compression framework that significantly reduces storage size while maintaining superior RD performance for FVV. Specifically, 4DGC introduces a motion-aware dynamic Gaussian representation that utilizes a compact motion grid combined with sparse compensated Gaussians to exploit inter-frame similarities. This representation effectively handles large motions, preserving quality and reducing temporal redundancy. Furthermore, we present an end-to-end compression scheme that employs differentiable quantization and a tiny implicit entropy model to compress the motion grid and compensated Gaussians efficiently. The entire framework is jointly optimized using a rate-distortion trade-off. Extensive experiments demonstrate that 4DGC supports variable bitrates and consistently outperforms existing methods in RD performance across multiple datasets.</p></details>|[2503.18421](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18421)|null|

In this paper, we propose DashGaussian, a scheduling scheme over the optimization complexity of 3DGS that strips redundant complexity to accelerate 3DGS optimization. Specifically, we formulate 3DGS optimization as progressively fitting 3DGS to higher levels of frequency components in the training views, and propose a dynamic rendering resolution scheme that largely reduces the optimization complexity based on this formulation. Besides, we argue that a specific rendering resolution should cooperate with a proper primitive number for a better balance between computing redundancy and fitting quality, where we schedule the growth of the primitives to synchronize with the rendering resolution. Extensive experiments show that our method accelerates the optimization of various 3DGS backbones by 45.7% on average while preserving the rendering quality.</p></details>|[2503.18402](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18402)|null|
|**2025-03-24**|**MonoInstance: Enhancing Monocular Priors via Multi-view Instance Alignment for Neural Rendering and Reconstruction**|<details><summary>Show Abstract</summary><p>Monocular depth priors have been widely adopted by neural rendering in multi-view based tasks such as 3D reconstruction and novel view synthesis. However, due to the inconsistent prediction on each view, how to more effectively leverage monocular cues in a multi-view context remains a challenge. Current methods treat the entire estimated depth map indiscriminately, and use it as ground truth supervision, while ignoring the inherent inaccuracy and cross-view inconsistency in monocular priors. To resolve these issues, we propose MonoInstance, a general approach that explores the uncertainty of monocular depths to provide enhanced geometric priors for neural rendering and reconstruction. Our key insight lies in aligning each segmented instance depths from multiple views within a common 3D space, thereby casting the uncertainty estimation of monocular depths into a density measure within noisy point clouds. For high-uncertainty areas where depth priors are unreliable, we further introduce a constraint term that encourages the projected instances to align with corresponding instance masks on nearby views. MonoInstance is a versatile strategy which can be seamlessly integrated into various multi-view neural rendering frameworks. Our experimental results demonstrate that MonoInstance significantly improves the performance in both reconstruction and novel view synthesis under various benchmarks.</p></details>|[2503.18363](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18363)|null|
|**2025-03-24**|**NeRFPrior: Learning Neural Radiance Field as a Prior for Indoor Scene Reconstruction**|<details><summary>Show Abstract</summary><p>Recently, it has shown that priors are vital for neural implicit functions to reconstruct high-quality surfaces from multi-view RGB images. However, current priors require large-scale pre-training, and merely provide geometric clues without considering the importance of color. In this paper, we present NeRFPrior, which adopts a neural radiance field as a prior to learn signed distance fields using volume rendering for surface reconstruction. Our NeRF prior can provide both geometric and color clues, and also get trained fast under the same scene without additional data. Based on the NeRF prior, we are enabled to learn a signed distance function (SDF) by explicitly imposing a multi-view consistency constraint on each ray intersection for surface inference. Specifically, at each ray intersection, we use the density in the prior as a coarse geometry estimation, while using the color near the surface as a clue to check its visibility from another view angle. For the textureless areas where the multi-view consistency constraint does not work well, we further introduce a depth consistency loss with confidence weights to infer the SDF. Our experimental results outperform the state-of-the-art methods under the widely used benchmarks.</p></details>|[2503.18361](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18361)|null|
